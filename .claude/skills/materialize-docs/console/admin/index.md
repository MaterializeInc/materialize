The **App Passwords** screen displays the various [client credentials
created](/console/create-new/#create-new-app-password-cloud-only) to allow your
applications and services to connect to Materialize.

- The [**Connect**](/console/connect/) button provides details needed to connect
to Materialize.

- The **trash can** button deletes the password.
