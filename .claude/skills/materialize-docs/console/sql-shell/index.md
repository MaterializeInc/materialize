# SQL Shell

## Purpose
SQL Shell in the Materialize console

If you need to understand the syntax and options for this command, you're in the right place.


SQL Shell in the Materialize console



The Materialize Console provides a **SQL
Shell**, where you can issue your queries. Materialize follows the SQL standard
(SQL-92) implementation, and strives for compatibility with the PostgreSQL
dialect. If your query takes too long to complete, the SQL Shell provides
**Query Insights** listing some possible causes.

The SQL Shell also includes:

- A top navigation panel, where you can select your cluster and database and
  schema.

- A [Quickstart](/get-started/quickstart/) tutorial. You can close the
  Quickstart by clicking the **Close Quickstart** button in the top-right
  corner.
