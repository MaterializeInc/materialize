How to stream data from Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL to Materialize


This page shows you how to stream data from [Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/)
to Materialize using the [PostgreSQL source](/sql/create-source/postgres/).

> **Tip:** 


## Before you begin

<!-- Unresolved shortcode: <!-- Unresolved shortcode: <!-- See original docs: postgres-direct/before-you-begin --> --> -->

## A. Configure Amazon RDS

This section covers a. configure amazon rds.

### 1. Enable logical replication

Materialize uses PostgreSQL's [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html)
protocol to track changes in your database and propagate them to Materialize.

As a first step, you need to make sure logical replication is enabled.

1. As a user with the `rds_superuser` role, use `psql` (or your preferred SQL
   client) to connect to your database.

1. Check if logical replication is enabled:

    ```postgres
    SELECT name, setting
      FROM pg_settings
      WHERE name = 'rds.logical_replication';
    ```text
    <p></p>

    ```nofmt
            name             | setting
    -------------------------+---------
    rds.logical_replication  | off
    (1 row)
    ```text

    - If logical replication is off, continue to the next step.

    - If logical replication is already on, skip to [Create a publication and a
      Materialize user section](#2-create-a-publication-and-a-replication-user).

1. Using the AWS Management Console, [create a DB parameter group in RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.Creating.html).

    - Set **Parameter group family** to your PostgreSQL version.
    - Set **Type** to **DB Parameter Group**.
    - Set **Engine type** to PostgreSQL.

1. Edit the new parameter group and set the `rds.logical_replication` parameter
   to `1`.

1. [Associate the DB parameter group with your database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.Associating.html).

    Use the **Apply Immediately** option to immediately reboot your database and
    apply the change. Keep in mind that rebooting the RDS instance can affect
    database performance.

    Do not move on to the next step until the database **Status**
    is **Available** in the RDS Console.

1. Back in the SQL client connected to PostgreSQL, verify that replication is
   now enabled:

    ```postgres
    SELECT name, setting
      FROM pg_settings
      WHERE name = 'rds.logical_replication';
    ```text
    <p></p>

    ``` nofmt
            name             | setting
    -------------------------+---------
    rds.logical_replication  | on
    (1 row)
    ```text

    If replication is still not enabled, [reboot the database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RebootInstance.html).

### 2. Create a publication and a replication user

## B. (Optional) Configure network security

> **Note:** 
If you are prototyping and your RDS instance is publicly accessible, **you can
skip this step**. For production scenarios, we recommend configuring one of the
network security options below.


#### Cloud

There are various ways to configure your database's network to allow Materialize
to connect:

- **Allow Materialize IPs:** If your database is publicly accessible, you can
    configure your database's security group to allow connections from a set of
    static Materialize IP addresses.

- **Use AWS PrivateLink**: If your database is running in a private network, you
    can use [AWS PrivateLink](/ingest-data/network-security/privatelink/) to
    connect Materialize to the database. For details, see [AWS PrivateLink](/ingest-data/network-security/privatelink/).

- **Use an SSH tunnel:** If your database is running in a private network, you
    can use an SSH tunnel to connect Materialize to the database.

#### Self-Managed

<!-- Unresolved shortcode: {{% include-md
file="shared-content/self-managed/c... -->

#### Allow Materialize IPs

1. In the AWS Management Console, [add an inbound rule to your RDS security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/changing-security-group.html#add-remove-instance-security-groups)
   to allow traffic from Materialize IPs.

    In each rule:

    - Set **Type** to **PostgreSQL**.
    - Set **Source** to the IP address in CIDR notation.

#### Use an SSH tunnel

To create an SSH tunnel from Materialize to your database, you launch an
instance to serve as an SSH bastion host, configure the bastion host to allow
traffic only from Materialize, and then configure your database's private
network to allow traffic from the bastion host.

> **Note:** 
Materialize provides a Terraform module that automates the creation and
configuration of resources for an SSH tunnel. For more details, see the
[Terraform module repository](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/terraform-aws-ec2-ssh-bastion).


1. [Launch an EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/LaunchingAndUsingInstances.html)
    to serve as your SSH bastion host.

    - Make sure the instance is publicly accessible and in the same VPC as your
      RDS instance.

    - Add a key pair and note the username. You'll use this username when
      connecting Materialize to your bastion host.

    **Warning:** Auto-assigned public IP addresses can change in [certain cases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses).
      For this reason, it's best to associate an [elastic IP address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#ip-addressing-eips)
      to your bastion host.

1. Configure the SSH bastion host to allow traffic only from Materialize.

1. In the security group of your RDS instance, [add an inbound rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-register-targets.html)
   to allow traffic from the SSH bastion host.

    - Set **Type** to **All TCP**.
    - Set **Source** to **Custom** and select the bastion host's security
      group.

## C. Ingest data in Materialize

This section covers c. ingest data in materialize.

### 1. (Optional) Create a cluster

> **Note:** 
If you are prototyping and already have a cluster to host your PostgreSQL
source (e.g. `quickstart`), **you can skip this step**. For production
scenarios, we recommend separating your workloads into multiple clusters for
[resource isolation](/sql/create-cluster/#resource-isolation).

### 2. Create a connection

Once you have configured your network, create a connection in Materialize per
your networking configuration.
