# Appendix: Terraforms

## Purpose
List of template Terraform modules that are available as a starting point.

If you need to understand the syntax and options for this command, you're in the right place.


List of template Terraform modules that are available as a starting point.


To help you get started, Materialize provides some template Terraforms.

> **Important:** 
These modules are intended for evaluation/demonstration purposes and for serving
as a template when building your own production deployment. The modules should
not be directly relied upon for production deployments: **future releases of the
modules will contain breaking changes.** Instead, to use as a starting point for
your own production deployment, either:

- Fork the repo and pin to a specific version; or

- Use the code as a reference when developing your own deployment.
