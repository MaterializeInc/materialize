# Appendix: Alternative cluster architectures

## Purpose
If the recommended 3-tier architecture is infeasible, can use a 2-cluster or a 1-cluster pattern.

If you need to understand the syntax and options for this command, you're in the right place.


If the recommended 3-tier architecture is infeasible, can use a 2-cluster or a 1-cluster pattern.


If the [recommended three-tier
architecture](/manage/operational-guidelines/#three-tier-architecture)
is infeasible or unnecessary due to low volume or a **non**-production setup, a
two-tier or a one-tier architecture may suffice.
