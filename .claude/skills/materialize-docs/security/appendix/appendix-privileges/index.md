## Purpose
List of available  privileges in Materialize.

If you need to understand the syntax and options for this command, you're in the right place.


List of available  privileges in Materialize.


> **Note:** 
Various SQL operations require additional privileges on related objects, such
as:

- For objects that use compute resources (e.g., indexes, materialized views,
  replicas, sources, sinks), access is also required for the associated cluster.

- For objects in a schema, access is also required for the schema.

For details on SQL operations and needed privileges, see [Appendix: Privileges
by command](/security/appendix/appendix-command-privileges/).


The following privileges are available in Materialize:


#### By Privilege

<!-- Dynamic table: rbac/privileges_objects - see original docs -->

#### By Object

<!-- Dynamic table: rbac/object_privileges - see original docs -->
