<!--
For EPD-wide tracking, assign the issue to the Product Roadmap GitHub project
and set the relevant attributes, including Team, Priority (Now/Next/Later),
Status. If you have a target date, set the Release Date attribute.
-->

## Product outcome

<!--
Briefly describe the desired product outcome. If possible, focus on the
customer's perspective, for example:

> Users can customize the Avro schema that is generated for a Kafka Avro sink. The customizations are limited to the common requests we've gotten to date.
-->

## Discovery

<!--
Briefly outline the discovery work that has happened or is planned to happen.

If you are working on a prototype or a design document, you should point it out
here. Once you have a design document, link it here. If there are other related
GitHub issues, link them here.

If you are skipping the discovery step, please point it out explicitly.
-->

## Work items

<!--
Break down the planned work items using GitHub's tasklist feature.

At a minimum, collect work items in the list below. Note that you can add
freeform text and link to specific issues (preferred). When you link to an
issue, GitHub will automatically add a backlink to this issue.

Consider breaking down the work items into multiple subsections, for example
multiple milestones or definite/possible/descoped work items. You will know
best what breakdown makes sense and the breakdown might evolve over time.

Please use the "problem" issue template for work items.
-->

```[tasklist]

```

## Decision log

<!--
Record all notable decisions as the project evolves, such as setting a target
date or changing the epic's scope or its breakdown. Please order entries in
descending order (the latest update should be the top most item).

Example:
> * **18 September 2023.** Added Nullability control for Avro-formatted sinks #21722 as a work item.
> * **28 August 2023.** Set a target release date of October 31.
-->

* **1 January 1970.** Issue created.
