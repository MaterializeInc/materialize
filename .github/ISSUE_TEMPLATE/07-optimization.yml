name: "Internal: proposed optimization"
description: A proposal for a new query optimization. Contributor use only.

  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Elevator pitch
      description: |
        Each question should be answered comprehensively but using as few sentences as possible. This is the only mandatory section needed for the issue to be discussed in a refinement session.
      value: |
        #### What does the transformation do?
        <!-- Give a representative SQL query. -->

        #### Why should we add it?

        #### When would it be good to have?
        <!-- This can be in terms of a lower-level IR instead of SQL. -->
        <!-- Link other issues, if they exist, that would be helped. -->

        #### When would it be ineffectual?

        #### When would be bad to have?

        #### In the worst case, how would it degrade performance?

      label: Cost model
      description: |
        Take into account memory, CPU, liveness, and skew. If possible, each subsection can be answered with formulae.

        If the transformation is always good to have, you only have to fill out the first subsection.
      value: |
        #### What is the benefit of the transformation?

        #### What is the overhead?

        #### When would the transformation be worthwhile?
        <!-- Intuitively, this should be when benefit > overhead, but sometimes a benefit with regards to X comes at a cost with regards to Y, and it would be worthwhile to discuss when it is worthwhile to sacrifice Y to gain a benefit in X. -->

      description: |
        List any knobs that we may need to be tune ourselves or expose to the user.

      label: User impact analysis
      description: |
        Take into account what you have seen from user queries, use cases,
        queries from benchmarks like TPC-H, etc.
      value: |
        #### How often will users input a query that can be helped by the transformation?

        #### Among the queries that can be helped, are there subclasses of queries that users will input more often?

      label: Proposed implementation
      description: |
        Implementation details can be filled in after there is consensus that the proposed optimization is worthwhile. If you already have an idea for the implementation, feel free to provide details.
      value: |
        #### Describe the implementation.

        #### What subset of queries that would benefit from this transformation does the implementation cover?

        #### What subset of queries that do worse with this transformation does the implementation fail to skip?

        #### Break the implementation down into stages.
