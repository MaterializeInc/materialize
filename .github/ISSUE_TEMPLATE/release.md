## Announce the imminent release internally

- [x] Create this release issue.
- [ ] Check for open blocking issues:
  - [ ] For any release, check if there are any open [`M-release-blocker`][rel-blockers]
    issues or PRs
  - [ ] If this is a major or minor release (any X.Y release) check if there are open
    issue or PRs with the [`M-milestone-blocker`][blocker-search] label, include them in
    a list here, or state that there are none:

  > unknown number of milestone blockers or release blockers
- [ ] Link to this issue in the #release Slack channel.

  If there are open blockers, clarify if they should block this release until they're
  merged when you link to this issue.

[rel-blockers]: https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AM-release-blocker

## Release candidate

A release candidate is the Materialize codebase at a given commit, tested for
production readiness.

### Create the release candidate

- [ ] Choose the commit for the release. Unless there are open release blockers above,
  this should just be the head commit of the main branch. Checkout that commit.
- [ ] Choose the name for the release candidate following the format
  `v<VERSION>-rc<N>`, where _N_ starts at 1. For example, the first RC for
  v0.2.3 would be called v0.2.3-rc1. Use that to run the `bin/mkrelease`
  script:

  ```shell
  tag=v<VERSION>-rc<N>
  bin/mkrelease -b rel-$tag $tag
  git push origin $tag
  ```

- [ ] *After* you have pushed that tag, on `main`, do the same thing for the
  dev version, without creating a tag:

  ```shell
  next=v<NEXT_VERSION>-dev
  bin/mkrelease --no-tag -b prepare-$next $next
  ```

  This must be done after the tag has been pushed, or Git will delete the tag
  that isn't on the server.

  - [ ] Open a PR with this change, and land it.

### Review Release Notes

Release notes should be updated by engineers as they merge PRs. The release notes
team is responsible for reviewing release notes and the release announcement before
a release is published.

- [ ] Comment on this issue and ping the @MaterializeInc/release-notes team to
  remind them to review the [release notes][] and the release announcement. All
  members of the team should leave a comment stating that the release looks
  good.

### Test the release candidate

To run the required load tests on the release candidate tag, Materialize employees
can follow [these instructions for running semi-automatic load tests][load-instr]
in the infrastructure repository. All of these tests can be run in parallel.

[load-instr]: https://github.com/MaterializeInc/infra/blob/main/doc/starting-a-load-test.md

- [ ] Kick off a [full SQL logic test run](https://buildkite.com/materialize/sql-logic-tests)
  by clicking the 'New Build' button. For the values requested, use the following:

    - Message: Leave blank
    - Commit - Use the default `HEAD`
    - Branch - Enter the release candidate tag (i.e. `v0.4.2-rc1`)

  You can continue on to the next step, but remember to verify that this test passes.

- [ ] Start the load tests according to [the same instructions][load-instr], using your release tag as the
  `git-ref` value for the release benchmarks. You can use [This commit][] as an example to follow.

[This commit]: https://github.com/MaterializeInc/infra/commit/fd7f594d6f9fb2fda3a604f21b730f8d401fe81c

- [ ] Find the load tests in https://grafana.i.mtrlz.dev/d/materialize-overview, and link
  to them in #release, validating that data is present. Note that the default view of
  that dashboard is of a full day, so it may look like the test started and aborted
  suddenly:

  - [ ] chbench
  - [ ] billing-demo
  - [ ] perf-kinesis

- [ ] Let the tests run for at least 24 hours, with the following success criteria:

  - [ ] Chbench should not have slower ingest than the previous release.
  - [ ] The billing-demo container should run and finish without error.
  - [ ] The "Time behind external source" dashboard panel in Grafana should have
    remained at 0ms or similar for the entirety of the run.

- [ ] Let the chaos tests run for 24 hours, with the following success criteria:

  - [ ] Each chaos test's `chaos_run` container should complete with a `0` exit code. To
    check this, SSH into each EC2 instance running a chaos test and run `docker ps -a`.
    You can ssh in using our [teleport cluster][], all chaos tests have a `purpose=chaos`
    label.

- [ ] Remove all load test machines, documented on [the same page][load-instr].

[teleport cluster]: https://tsh.i.mtrlz.dev/cluster/tsh/nodes

## Final release

### Create Git tag

- [ ] Create the final release based on the final RC tag. For example, if there
  was only one RC, then the final RC tag would be `-rc1`.

  ```shell
  $ tag=v<VERSION>
  $ bin/mkrelease --checkout ${tag}-rc1 $tag
  git push origin $tag
  ```

### Verify the Release Build and Deploy

- [ ] Find your build in buildkite, for example
  https://buildkite.com/materialize/tests/builds?branch=v0.4.3
- [ ] Wait for the completion of the "Deploy" step

### Create Homebrew bottle and update tap

- [ ] Follow the instructions in [MaterializeInc/homebrew-materialize's
  CONTRIBUTING.md][homebrew-guide].

### Verify the Debian package

- [ ] Run the following command on a Docker-enabled machine and verify you see
  the correct version.

  ```shell
  docker run --rm -i ubuntu:bionic <<EOF
  apt-get update && apt-get install -y gpg ca-certificates
  apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 379CE192D401AB61
  sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.materialize.io/apt/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/materialize.list'
  apt-get update && apt-get install -y materialized
  materialized --version
  EOF
  ```

### Convert the GitHub Tag into a GitHub Release

- [ ] Go to [the GitHub releases][releases] page and find the tag that you
  created as part of the "Final Release" step.

  - Click "Edit" on the top right
  - Leave the name blank, so that the tag's version is used as the name.
  - Use the following contents as the description, updating the version
    number appropriately:
    ```markdown
    * [Release notes](https://materialize.io/docs/release-notes/#v0.#.#)
    * [Binary tarballs](https://materialize.io/docs/versions/)
    * [Installation instructions](https://materialize.io/docs/install/)
    * [Documentation](https://materialize.io/docs/)
    ```

### Update the main branch for the next version

- [ ] On `main`, update the various files that must be up to date:

  - [ ] Ensure that the [release notes] are up to date, including the current version.

  - [ ] Add the version to the website's list of versions in [`doc/user/config.toml`].

  - [ ] Ensure that all members of the release-notes team have signed-off on this issue.

  - [ ] Ensure that the announcement blog post has been published and
    announced, if applicable, by pinging the product team in #release.

## Finish

- [ ] Update the current status at the top of this issue.
- [ ] Close this issue.
