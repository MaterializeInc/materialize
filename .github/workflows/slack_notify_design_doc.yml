# Send a notification to the #eng-design-docs Slack channel when a new
# design doc is added.
#
# A notification is sent when all of these conditions are true:
#   * A ready-to-review PR is (re-)opened, or a PR is moved from draft
#     to ready-to-review.
#   * The PR adds an '.md' document under 'doc/developer/design/'.
