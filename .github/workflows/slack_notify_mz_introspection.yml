# Send a notification to the #epd-mz-introspection-council Slack channel when a change
# is made that adds or modifies an index on the mz_introspection cluster, or
# adds or modifies an object on which those indices depend.
# Also detects changes to catalog object retention.
#
# A notification is sent when all of these conditions are true:
#   * A ready-to-review PR is (re-)opened, or a PR is moved from draft
#     to ready-to-review.
#   * The PR modifies the file 'test/sqllogictest/mz_introspection_index_accounting.slt',
#     which is designed to detect new or modified mz_introspection indexes, OR
#   * The PR changes the "is_retained_metrics..." field of any catalog object,
#     as detected in the file 'src/catalog/src/builtin.rs'.
