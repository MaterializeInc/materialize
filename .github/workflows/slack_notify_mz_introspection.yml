# Send a notification to the #epd-mz-introspection-council Slack channel when a change
# is made that adds a new index to the mz_introspection cluster.
#
# A notification is sent when all of these conditions are true:
#   * A ready-to-review PR is (re-)opened, or a PR is moved from draft
#     to ready-to-review.
#   * The PR modifies the file 'src/catalog/src/builtin.rs'.
#   * The PR adds a "BuiltinIndex" to the file.
