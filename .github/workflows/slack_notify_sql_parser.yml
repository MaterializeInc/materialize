# Send a notification to the #epd-sql-council Slack channel when a change
# to the SQL parser or the system catalog schema is made.
#
# A notification is sent when all of these conditions are true:
#   * A ready-to-review PR is (re-)opened, or a PR is moved from draft
#     to ready-to-review.
#   * The PR modifies a file in 'src/sql-parser/','src/sql-lexer/', or 'src/catalog/src/builtin.rs'.
