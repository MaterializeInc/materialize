# Emit only the line info tables, not full debug info, in release builds, to
# substantially reduce the size of the debug info. Line info tables are enough
# to correctly symbolicate a backtrace, but do not produce an ideal interactive
# debugger experience. This seems to be the right tradeoff for release builds:
# it's unlikely we're going to get interactive access to a debugger in
# production installations, but we still want useful crash reports.
