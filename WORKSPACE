"""
Materialize's Bazel Workspace.

This `WORKSPACE` file defines all of the rule sets and remote repositories that
we depend on. It's important to note that ordering matters. If an object is
declared more than once it's the _first_ invocation that gets used. This can be
especially tricky when rule sets have their own dependencies, generally
included by calling a `*_dependencies()` macro.
"""

# `bazel-lib`/`bazel-skylib`
#
# Provides generic rules for Bazel to help make things fit together.
#
# For example, Rust build scripts might require files live in a certain
# location, but the dependent `c_library` can't specify an output location.
# `bazel-lib` provides rules to copy files into a new directory that we can
# then provide to the Rust rule.
#
# Note: In an ideal world the two rule sets would be combined into one.

# `rules_foreign_cc`
#
# Rules for building C/C++ projects that use foreign build systems, e.g. Make. One case that we use
# this for is building `openssl`.
#
# TODO(parkmycar): We maintain a fork with the following fixes applied to the `mz-fixes` branch:
#
# 1. Versions of `make` >4.3 are buggy and have a segfault, we hit this segfault when building jemalloc.
#    See: <https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc/issues/898>
#    See: <https://github.com/MaterializeInc/rules_foreign_cc/commit/8e28ba0bbbf7e73d70333b625bfec4a65114d8be>
#
# 2. Some libraries, e.g. jemalloc, preprocess and compile code in two separate steps, so we need
#    to make sure the sysroot is provided in CPPFLAGS, if it's set in CFLAGS.
#    See: <https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc/pull/1023>
#    See: <https://github.com/MaterializeInc/rules_foreign_cc/commit/2199b1c304140fa959c3703b0b7e9cbf7d39c4c2>
#
# 3. Specify the AR tool to use when bootstrapping `make`. On macOS explicitly set the path to
#    be llvm-ar which we know exists in our toolchain.
#    See: <https://github.com/MaterializeInc/rules_foreign_cc/commit/e94986f05edf95fff025b6aeb995e09be8889b89>
#
# 4. `make` 4.2 fails to compile on Linux because of unrecognized symbols so we patch the source.
#    See: <https://github.com/MaterializeInc/rules_foreign_cc/commit/de4a79280f54d8796e86b7ab0b631939b7b44d05>
