    # The style and complexity lints frustrated too many engineers and caused

    # clippy::large_enum_variant complains when enum variants have divergent
    # sizes, as the size of an enum is determined by the size of its largest
    # element. Obeying this lint is nearly always a premature optimization,
    # and the suggested solution—boxing the large variant—might actually result
    # in slower code due to the allocation.

    # clippy::mutable_key_type disallows using internally mutable types as keys in `HashMap`,
    # because their order could change. This is a good lint in principle, but its current
    # implementation is too strict -- it disallows anything containing an `Arc` or `Rc`,
    # for example.
