# Packages required for developer tools.
#
# We allow more packages here than in requirements.txt, but please still be
# thoughtful about adding dependencies. Packages with native dependencies (e.g.,
# psycopg2) tend to be troublesome unless they ship binary wheels for a wide
# variety of platforms, including M1 Macs.
