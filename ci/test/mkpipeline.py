"""Generator for the test CI pipeline.

This script takes pipeline.template.yml as input, possibly trims out jobs
whose inputs have not changed relative to the code on main, and uploads the
resulting pipeline to the Buildkite job that triggers this script.

On main and tags, all jobs are always run.

For details about how steps are trimmed, see the comment at the top of
pipeline.template.yml and the docstring on `trim_pipeline` below.
