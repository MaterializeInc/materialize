# mkpipeline.sh â€” dynamically renders a pipeline.yml for Buildkite.

# This script's path is hardcoded into the Buildkite UI. It bootstraps the CI
# process by building the CI builder image, in which all other dependencies
# are installed. Unfortunately that means this script needs to be written in
# Bash, since our Python tools are only available once the CI builder image has
# been built.
