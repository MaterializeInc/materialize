# Developer documentation

This is the root directory of the Materialize developer documentation, which
describes our engineering process and philosophy.

For a more general introduction to Materialize, see the [user
documentation](https://materialize.com/docs). For API documentation, see
[dev.materialize.com](https://dev.materialize.com).

## New contributors

If you're a new contributor, we recommend reading the following chapters in the
user documentation, if you haven't already:

  1. [Get Started](https://materialize.com/docs/get-started/)
  2. [What Is Materialized?](https://materialize.com/docs/overview/what-is-materialize/)
  3. [Architecture Overview](https://materialize.com/docs/overview/architecture/)

Then, once you're up to speed, dive into the [developer guide](guide.md). The
guide is intended to be skimmed from start to finish, to give you the lay of the
land, and then browsed as reference material as you skill up on the codebase.

## Table of contents

* [ci-regexp.md](ci-regexp.md) describes how to mark a CI issue with a regular
  expression to ignore it in future CI runs.

* [change-data-capture.md](change-data-capture.md) describes our change data
  capture (CDC) requirements.

* [debugging.md](debugging.md) is a guide to debugging Materialize using
  rust-gdb / rust-lldb.

* Our diagnostics guide is a work in progress. The sections we have so far are
  themselves works in progress. Feel free to add to them if you think up of
  something useful.
  * [diagnostic-queries.md](diagnostic-queries.md) has queries to find the
    specific, problematic Timely/Differential operators.
  * [diagnostic-questions.md](diagnostic-questions.md) is a checklist of
    higher-level things to look for and think about if something is not working
    as expected.

* [fast-compiles.md](fast-compiles.md) describes various tricks for speeding
  up Rust compilation.

* [guide.md](guide.md) walks you through hacking on this codebase and our
  development philosophy.

  Several sections of the guide are important enough to warrant their own
  documents:

  * [guide-changes.md](guide-changes.md) describes practices and expectations for
    committing and reviewing code.
  * [guide-testing.md](guide-testing.md) describes our various test suites and
    our testing philosophy.

* [mzbuild.md](mzbuild.md) describes the custom build system we use to manage
  our Docker images and Docker Compose configurations.

* [publishing.md](publishing.md) details how to publish packages, like Rust
  crates or Docker images.

* [reading.md](reading.md) contains a reading list.

* [sqllogictest.md](sqllogictest.md) contains detailed information about
  our SQL logic testing framework.

* [tracing.md](tracing.md) explains what tracing is, why we do it, and what
  our best practices are

* We have basic introductions for developers for various parts of the system:
  * [Query Compilation 101](101-query-compilation.md) (for members of the optimizer team).
