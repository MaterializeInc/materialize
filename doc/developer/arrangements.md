# Understanding what Costs in Materialize

Materialize builds dataflow graphs that represents queries.
The operators in these graphs can either be *stateless* (as in a Map, Filter, or Project operator) or *stateful*.
Stateful operators hold on to arrangements of records, which are the main contributor to memory footprint in Materialize.
Arrangements can be shared between operators that need the same data, which can ameliorate some of the cost.

Let's talk through what an arrangement is, which operators require arrangements, and what we can do about them.

## What is an "Arrangement"?

An arrangement is an alternative representation of a stream of update triples `(data, time, diff)`.
In stream form, the triple pass by and are gone.
An arrangement records these triples, and indexes them by `data`.
With some caveats about "logical compaction", the index maintains the *current* accumulation of `diff` for each `(data, time)`.
This means that the size of an arrangement should be roughly the current size of the accumulated updates, where "zero" accumulations contribute nothing.
An arrangement undergoes "physical compaction" lazily, which means that the actual size of an arrangement can exceed the logical size, for what should be a bounded amount of time.

An arrangement only costs proportional to the number of distinct `(data, time)` pairs.
This number can be small even if the number of records is large, if we were able to reduce `data` to few values.
For example, if we want to histogram taxi rides by number of occupants and fare amount, there may be few distinct pairs despite many records.

Arrangements are actually indexed assuming that `data` has a `(key, val)` structure.
The index is by `key`, which will be important in understanding when arrangements can be shared and reused.
Materialize will attempt to choose a `key` to ensure that the data are well distributed.
For example, if a collection has a primary key, Materialize will default to this key for an arrangement.
Each of `key` and `val` can be `()`, corresponding to "no key" and "the key is the value", respectively.

To investigate the existing arrangements, query the `mz_arrangement_sizes` logging source.
There are several diagnostic views in `mz_catalog` that connect this information to operator names, and group it by dataflow.

## Which operators need Arrangements?

We create more arrangements that just those to house materialized sources and views.
Many internal operators require arrangements so that they can respond efficiently to changes.
For example, the differential dataflow `join` operator requires that each of its two inputs be an arrangement.
Specifically, each arrangement must have as its `key` the fields that will be equated by the join.
Additionally, the differential dataflow `reduce` operator requires that both its input and its output be an arrangement.
These two operators are at the heart of the arrangement use in Materialize, because we construct relational operators out of them.

Materialize has several relational operators that are "rendered" using differential `join` and `reduce` operators.
These are the operators you would see in `explain plan for <query>`.
There is a more complicated mapping from SQL to these operators.

---

Our `Join` operator joins together a sequence of input relations.
It creates a sequence of differential `join` operators, each of which need to have both inputs be arrangements.
This means that in addition to arranging each of the join inputs, it arranges each of the intermediate results.
For example, in the figure below, each `A` is an arrangement.

```
    In2 --> A  In3 --> A  In4 --> A
             \          \          \
    In1 --> A-Join --> A-Join --> A-Join --> Out
```

To join four inputs together, there are six arrangements.
Some of these input arrangements could be shared, but most likely the intermediate arrangements cannot.

---

Our `Reduce` operator builds a non-trivial dataflow subgraph (which may be subject to change).
Informally, for aggregation we build its own dataflow.
That dataflow may begin with a `reduce` operator to implement the `distinct` keyword.
Then there is either
    * a single `reduce` operator (for sums, counts, any, all), or
    * a sequence of 16 `reduce` operators (for min and max), or
    * a single `reduce` operator (for `jsonbagg` and others).
Finally, last `reduce` collects each of the aggregates into one record for each key.
There are special cases when there are few (zero or one) reductions.

---

Our `TopK` operator builds a sequence of 16 `reduce` operators.
Each `reduce` operator applies the `TopK` logic over progressively coarser groups
The final group is just by the group key.

---

Our `Threshold` operator creates one `reduce` operator.

---

Our `ArrangeBy` operator creates one arrangement.

---

For each of these relational operators, the associated memory footprint should determined by the sizes of the arranged collections.

## Caveats: Shared Arrangements

Arrangements may be shared between operators in the same dataflow, or across dataflows if an arrangement is published by the dataflow that creates it.
Arrangements are most commonly published by the creation of indexes, materialized sources, and materialized views.
Materialize does not currently publish other arrangements.

The `Join` operator requires arrangements each with `key` equal to the columns that will be equated.
When joining with a collection that has a primary key, we may have that arrangement available.
In this case, we are able to re-use the existing arrangement, and incur no additional memory use for this arrangement.

The `Reduce` operator concludes with an arrangement of its output, whose `key` is the grouping key.
It is not uncommon to re-use this arrangement, as we find that such groupings are often followed by joins.

The `mz_arrangement_sharing` logging source reports the number of times each arrangement is shared.
An arrangement is identified by the worker and operator that created it.

## Caveats: Demand Analysis

When users present queries and views to us, we can determine that some fields are not required.
We blank out any field that is not required.
This can reduce the number of distinct `data` in an arrangement, which will reduce the size of the arrangement.

## Caveats: Delta Joins

In certain circumstances, we plan `Join` operators using a different pattern which avoids the intermediate arrangements.
The alternate plan uses more arrangements, but the arrangements are more likely to be shareable with other queries.
Informally, if all collections have arrangements by all of their primary and foreign keys, we can apply the Delta Join plan.

The plan removes the requirement that the intermediate results be arranged, but requires a separate dataflow for each input.
For example, we would be able to write the following dataflow to handle changes to `In1`:
```
    In2 --> A  In3 --> A  In4 --> A
             \          \          \
    In1 ----> Join ----> Join ----> Join --> Out
```
But, we would also need to create similar dataflow graphs for each of `In2`, `In3`, and `In4`.
In each case they only require arrangements of the input, but they may be by different keys.

If a `Join` is implemented by a Delta Join pattern, it will create zero additional arrangements.
