# <Insert Name of Feature>

- Associated: (Insert list of associated epics, issues, or PRs)

<!--
Note: Feel free to add or remove sections as needed. However, most design
docs should at least keep the suggested sections.
-->

## Context

<!--
Bring the reader up to speed enough, such that they can understand the
following goals and descriptions.

An important reason for this is helping future readers understand the
assumptions that went into the design, and in turn the goals and design itself.

Be sure to capture the customer impact/customer problem, which should be the
motivation for the proposed design!
-->

## Goals

<!--
Enumerate the concrete goals that are in scope for the project.
-->

## Non-Goals

<!--
Enumerate potential goals that are explicitly _out_ of scope for the project
ie. what could we do or what do we want to do in the future - but are not doing
now.
-->

## Overview

<!--
Brief, high-level overview. A few sentences long, at most a couple of smaller
paragraphs.
-->

## Detailed description

<!--
Describe the approach in detail. If there is no clear frontrunner, feel free to
list all approaches in alternatives. If applicable, be sure to call out any new
testing/validation that will be required.

For some features it can be helpful to sketch an implementation. If you're
working on things that are crossing team boundaries it will be helpful to spell
out any new interfaces/traits/interactions.

For most new features, you should think about testing, rollout/lifecycle, and
observability. These things can warrant their own sections.
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
Similar to the Description section. List of alternative approaches considered,
pros/cons or why they were not chosen.
-->

## Open questions

<!--
Anything currently unanswered that needs specific focus. This section may be
expanded during the doc meeting as other unknowns are pointed out. These
questions may be technical, product, or anything in-between.
