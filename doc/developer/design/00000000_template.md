One paragraph to explain the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use-cases does it enable? What is the desired outcome?

# Explanation
[explanation]: #explanation

Explain the design as if it were part of Materialize and you were teaching the team about it.
This can mean:

- Introduce new named concepts.
- Explain the feature using examples that demonstrate product-level changes.
- Explain how engineers and users should think about this change, and how it influences how everyone uses the product.
- If needed, talk though errors, backwards-compatibility, or migration strategies.
- Discuss how this affects maintainability, or whether it introduces concets that might be hard to change in the future.

# Reference explanation
[reference-explanation]: #reference-explanation

Focus on the implementation of the feature.
This is the technical part of the design.

- It is reasonably clear how the feature is implemented.
- What dependencies does the feature have and introduce?
- Focus on corner cases.
- How can we test the feature and protect against regressions?

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Conclusion and alternatives
[conclusion-and-alternatives]: #conclusion-and-alternatives

- Why is the design the best to solve the problem?
- What other designs have been considered, and what were the reasons to not pick any other?
- What is the impact of not implementing this design?
