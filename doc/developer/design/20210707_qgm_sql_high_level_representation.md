# QGM as high level representation for SQL queries

## Summary

<!--
// Brief, high-level overview. A few sentences long.
// Be sure to capture the customer impact - framing this as a release note may be useful.
-->

This document proposes to replace the current `HirRelationExpr` enum with a new representation
based on the Query Graph Model representation first introduced in
[H. Pirahesh et al](http://projectsweb.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/db/weld/pirahesh-starburst-92.pdf).

This new representation would allow us to introduce a new normalization stage before lowering the query
into a dataflow, before important concepts for the normalization of SQL queries, such as outer joins and
subquery boundaries, are blurred. The following two diagrams show the current view/query compilation pipeline
and the one proposed in this document, which adds normalization at the SQL level:

## Goals

<!--
// Enumerate the concrete goals that are in scope for the project.
-->

* The high level representation of SQL queries must:
    * represent the query at a conceptual level, free of syntactic concepts,
    * be a self-contained data structure,
    * be easy to use,
    * be normalization-friendly,
    * allow supporting complex features such as recursion in CTEs,
* Proper support of `LATERAL` joins ([#6875](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/6875))
* Support for functional dependency analysis during name resolution
([#7647](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/7647)).

Existing issues that should be addressed sooner rather than later:
* [sql: handle aggregates that refer exclusively to outer columns #3720](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/3720)
* [sql: make SQL responsible for its equality semantics #7597](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/7597)
* [sql: wrong results with outer join due to incorrect name resolution  #7618](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/7618)
* [sql: ambiguous column name error reported for equivalent expressions in the selection list](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/7549)
* [Ignore the selection list in EXISTS subqueries](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/6490)

## Non-Goals

* List transformations that will be applied during normalization

## Description

<!--
// Describe the approach in detail. If there is no clear frontrunner, feel free to list all approaches in alternatives.
// If applicable, be sure to call out any new testing/validation that will be required
-->

In QGM, a query, as its name implies, is represented as a graph. This graph will be represented
by a `Model` struct, that will be declared as follows:

```rust
/// A Query Graph Model instance represents a SQL query.
struct Model {
    /// The ID of the box representing the entry-point of the query.
    top_box: BoxId,
    /// All boxes in the query graph model.
    boxes: HashMap<BoxId, Box<RefCell<QueryBox>>>,
    /// Used for asigning unique IDs to query boxes.
    next_box_id: Boxid,
    /// All quantifiers in the query graph model.
    quantifiers: HashMap<QuantifierId, Box<RefCell<Quantifier>>>,
    /// Used for assigning unique IDs to quantifiers.
    next_quantifier_id: QuantifierId,
}
```

The graph has a top level box, which is the entry point of the query. In this proposal, all boxes and quantifiers
are owned by the model and are referenced by their unique identifiers.

Boxes represent high-level conceptual operators, ie. they don't correspond to any execution strategy. Each box
has a set of input quantifiers, which describe the semantics of how the underlying boxes will be accessed.

The following snippet contains the definition of the different types of operators and quantifiers. Since
all type of boxes and quantifiers have some elements in common, both boxes and quantifiers are not directly
represented as enum, but as struct with an enum type, containing the per-type specific members.

```rust

type QuantifierId = usize;
type BoxId = usize;
type QuantifierSet = BTreeSet<QuantifierId>;

/// A semantic operator within a Query Graph.
struct QueryBox {
    /// uniquely identifies the box within the model
    id: BoxId,
    /// the type of the box
    box_type: BoxType,
    /// the projection of the box
    columns: Vec<Column>,
    /// the input quantifiers of the box
    quantifiers: QuantifierSet,
    /// quantifiers ranging over this box
    ranging_quantifiers: QuantifierSet,
    /// list of unique keys exposed by this box. Each unique key is made by
    /// a list of column positions. Must be re-computed every time the box
    /// is modified.
    unique_keys: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    /// whether this box must enforce the uniqueness of its output, it is
    /// guaranteed by structure of the box or it must preserve duplicated
    /// rows from its input boxes.
    distinct: DistinctOperation,
}

enum BoxType {
    BaseTable(BaseTable),
    Except,
    Grouping(Grouping),
    Intersect,
    OuterJoin(OuterJoin),
    Select(Select),
    TableFunction(TableFunction),
    Union,
    Values(Values),
}

enum DistinctOperation {
    /// DISTINCTness is required but guaranteed by the internal structure
    /// of the box.
    Guaranteed,
    /// The box must enforce DISTINCT
    Enforce,
    /// DISTINCTness is not required
    Preserve,
}

struct Quantifier {
    /// uniquely identifiers the quantifier within the model
    id: QuantifierId,
    /// the type of the quantifier
    quantifier_type: QuantifierType,
    /// the input box of this quantifier
    input_box: BoxId,
    /// the box that owns this quantifier
    parent_box: BoxId,
    /// alias for name resolution purposes
    alias: Option<Ident>,
}

/// Type of quantifiers (with their abbreviations)
enum QuantifierType {
    All,               // 'All'
    Any,               // 'Any'
    Existential,       // 'E'
    Foreach,           // 'F'
    PreservedForeach,  // 'P'
    Scalar,            // 'S'
}
```

Note that input quantifiers are logically owned by a single box, but there may be several quantifiers ranging
over the same box. That is the case, for example, for base tables, views or CTEs, either explicit CTEs used in
the query or discovered via some query transformation.

As shown above, there aren't many different types of operators, since QGM is meant to be a representation for
query normalization. The set of operators listed above is very close to the one suggested in
[#692](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/692).

The core operator is represented by the `Select` box, which represents a whole query block (sub-block).

```rust
struct Select {
    predicates: Vec<Box<Expr>>,
    order_key: Option<Vec<Box<Expr>>>,
    limit: Option<Expr>,
    offset: Option<Expr>,
}
```

There a few subtle constraints that are not explicit in the representation above:

* `BaseTable`, `TableFunction` and `Values` cannot have input quantifiers.
* `Union`, `Except` and `Intersect` can only have input quantifiers of type `Foreach`.
* Distinctness can only be enforced in `Select`, `Union`, `Except` and `Intersect` boxes.
* Subquery quantifiers (`All`, `Any`, `Existential` and `Scalar`) are only allowed in `Select` boxes.
* `Grouping` must have a single input quantifier of type `Foreach` ranging over a `Select` box.
* A `Grouping` box is always ranged-over by a `Select` box.
* `OuterJoin` must have at least an input quantifier of type `PreservedForeach` and at most one quantifier of type
  `Foreach`. An `OuterJoin` with all `PreservedForeach` input quantifiers represents a `FULL OUTER JOIN`.
  Note: temporarily during the generation of the query model we could allow subquery quantifiers in `OuterJoin` boxes for
  subqueries in the `ON`-clause of the outer join, but should push down the subquery to the non-preserving side.
  Note 2: In QGM there is no distinction between a `LEFT JOIN` and a `RIGHT JOIN`, since that's a concept that belongs
  only in the AST.
* `PreservedForeach` quantifiers can only exist in `OuterJoin` boxes.

Some of the constraints above are just conventions for making query transformation easier due to having to cover
fewer cases. The rest are just constructions that don't make sense semantically speaking.

We could make some of these constraints explicit by making the type system enforce them, by, for example
moving the `quantifiers` set to each of the `BoxType` that can/must have input quantifiers, which are all of
them but `BaseTable`, `TableFunction` and `Values`.

All boxes have an ordered projection, represented as a vector of columns, defined as:

```rust
struct Column {
    expr: Expr,
    alias: Option<String>,
}
```

### Notes on expression representation

Columns have two representations in QGM: base columns and column references. Base columns are only allowed in expressions
contained in data source operators, specifically in the projection of boxes of type `BaseTable` and `TableFunction`.

```rust
enum Expr {
    // ...
    ColumnReference(ColumnReference),
    BaseColumn(usize),
}

struct ColumnReference {
    quantifier_id: QuantifierId,
    position: usize,
}
```

`ColumnReference` is used everywhere else. A `ColumnReference` may either reference a quantifier of the same
box that owns the containing expression or a quantifier from some parent box.

The underlying expression behind a column reference can be obtained via a `dereference` method, whose implementation
could be as follows:

```rust
impl ColumnReference {
    fn dereference<'a>(&self, model: &'a Model) -> &'a Expr {
        let input_box = model
            .quantifiers
            .get(&self.quantifier_id)
            .unwrap()
            .input_box;
        &model.boxes.get(&input_box).unwrap().columns[self.position].expr
    }
}
```

Since this proposal uses identifiers instead of pointers, most methods in the implementation `Expr` will need to
receive a reference to the model as a parameter. For example, a method for determining whether an expression is
nullable or not may need to dereference a column reference, for which it needs access to the model:

```rust
impl Expr {
    fn nullable(&self, model: &Model) -> bool {
        match self {
            ...
            Expr::ColumnReference(c) => c.dereference(model).nullable(model),
        }
    }
}
```

### Name resolution

As shown above, the query graph already contains almost all the information needed for name resolution. Since the
query graph is built in a bottom-up manner, we can use the input quantifiers for resolving names within the
current part of the query being processed.

It is important to restate the constraint mentioned above: all column references in expressions within each box
*must* only point to quantifiers either within the same box or within an ancestor box through a chain of unique
children (correlation).

The only information missing in the query graph needed for name resolution purposes is what quantifiers can be
used for name resolution within each box/context. That information is stored in a new `NameResolutionContext`
defined as:

```rust
struct NameResolutionContext<'a> {
    owner_box: Option<BoxId>,
    quantifiers: Vec<QuantifierId>,
    ctes: Option<HashMap<String, BoxId>>,
    parent_context: Option<&'a NameResolutionContext<'a>>,
    sibling_context: Option<&'a NameResolutionContext<'a>>,
    is_lateral: bool,
}
```

`parent_context` is a linked list that points to the context of the outer query (the context of its FROM clause)
and, hence, it is only set within a context that is meant to see the outer query (for example, a subquery).

`sibling_context` is a linked list that connects all the intermediate joins from the current one to the comma-join
of the FROM clause. This linked list is only meant to be traversed when `is_lateral` is `true`. From within a lateral
join operand, we have to traverse the list of `sibling_context`s first, ie. move laterally, and them up.

All the contexts in the `sibling_context` share the same parent context, ie. the same outer query.

`quantifiers` contains leaf quantifiers of the join, the ones that are used for name resolution.

A new `NameResolutionContext` is created for each intermediate join within the join tree, which leaves quantifiers
are merged into the context of the parent join after processing the intermeidate join, unless it is a nested
join with an alias. In that case, the quantifier that is added in the parent context is the one ranging over
the sub-join. This distinction is needed to properly support this case:

```
materialize=> select * from a, (b inner join c on true) where b.b > 1;
 a | b | c
---+---+---
(0 rows)

materialize=> select * from a, (b inner join c on true) z where b.b > 1;
ERROR:  WHERE clause error: column "b.b" does not exist
materialize=>
```

When a colum name is resolved against any of the leaf quantifiers in the current context, the resulting column
reference must be lifted through the projection of all the intermediate boxes until reaching a quantifier
in the current box (the one referenced in `NameResolutionContext::owner_box` in the current context).

#### Name resolution in LATERAL joins

A lateral join operand must see all quantifiers at its left in all the intermediate joins up to the comma join.
In the following example query there is a lateral join operand in the rightmost position of the join tree,
that must see the symbols from the tables in the left-hand side of all the intermediate joins up to the comma-join
(included).

![Name resolution in joins](static/qgm/name-resolution-1.svg)

Box16 represents the lateral join operand. When processing its content, the context stack looks like this:

```
Context 16 {
 owner_box = 16
 quantifiers = {10}
 sibling_context = None
 parent_context = Some(Context 13)
 is_lateral = false
}

Context 13 {
 owner_box = 13
 quantifiers = {9}
 sibling_context = Some(Context 9)
 parent_context = None
 is_lateral = true
}

Context 9 {
 owner_box = 9
 quantifiers = {7}
 sibling_context = Some(Context 5)
 parent_context = None
 is_lateral = false
}

Context 5 {
 owner_box = 5
 quantifiers = {5}
 sibling_context = Some(Context 0)
 parent_context = None
 is_lateral = false
}

Context 0 {
 owner_box = 0
 quantifiers = {1, 3}
 sibling_context = None
 parent_context = None
 is_lateral = false
}
```

After processing the join tree in the FROM clause, we end up with the following Context 0 for processing the
expressions in the projection and ORDER BY:

```
Context 0 {
 quantifiers = {1(a), 3(b), 5(c), 7(d), 9(f), 12(<anonymous>)}
 sibling_context = None
 parent_context = None
 is_lateral = false
}
```

Note that Boxes 8 and 12 are pass-through boxes created by the prototype every time there is a join within parenthesis.
`SelectMerge` rewrite will take care of them. Boxes 2, 4, 7, 11, 15 and 18 are just there for the column aliases.

#### Name resolution within subqueries

Expressions within subqueries must see the symbols visible from the context the subquery is in. To support that
`NameResolutionContext` will contain an optional reference to a parent `NameResolutionContext`, that is passed
down for planning the subquery, so that if a name cannot be resolved against the context of the `FROM` clause of
the subquery, we go through the chain of parent contexts until we find a symbol that matches in one of them.

#### Name resolution of `GROUP BY` queries

A `SELECT` query is a grouping query if any of the following conditions is met:

* the query has a `GROUP BY` clause.
* the query has a `HAVING` clause,
* the projection of the query contains any aggregate which parameters are constant,
* the projection of the query contains any aggregate where all columns referenced within it come from the tables
  in the `FROM` clause, either directly in the projection or within a subquery
  (see [#3720](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/3720))

That means that in order to determine whether a query is a grouping query or not, we must inspect the projection
of the query first. For this reason, after having processed the `FROM` clause and the `WHERE` clause, we will
process the projection of the query, resolving names agains the `NameResolutionContext` for the join of the
query, and then will traverse the resulting expressions trying to find `Aggregate` expressions within
non-`Grouping` boxes, which would make the current query being process a grouping one.

If any `Aggregate` expression is found, we will put a `Grouping` box on top of the `Select` box containing
the join in the `FROM` clause, and will try to lift all expressions in the projection through it, following
the rules listed below.

Symbols in the `GROUP BY` clause will be resolved as well against the `NameResolutionContext` representing
the scope exposed by the `FROM` clause, but then lifted through the projection of the `Select` box representing
the join that feeds the `Grouping` box created for the `GROUP BY` clause.

Symbols in the `HAVING` clause and in the projection of the `GROUP BY` are also resolved against the
`NameResolutionContext` of the `FROM` clause, but then lifted twice: once through the `Select` box representing
the join that feeds the `Grouping` box and then through the `Grouping` box itself (since the projection
of a `GROUP BY` and the predicates in the `HAVING` clause belong in `Select` box on top of the `Grouping` box).

Lifting expressions through a grouping box is a bit special:

* The projection of a `Grouping` box can only contain: columns references from the input quantifier that are
  present in the grouping key, references to columns from the input quantifier that functionally depend on a column
  in the grouping key, or aggregate expressions, which parameters must be column references from the input quantifier.
* Aggregate expressions are lifted as column references.
* Columns from the input quantifier that neither appear in the grouping nor functionally depend on any column in the
  grouping key, cannot be lifted and hence an error is returned.

Expression planning will then be divided in two stages: name resolution against the scope of the `FROM` clause
and expression lifting through the `Grouping` (only for grouping queries).

#### Name resolution of CTEs

A `NameResolutionContext` instance will be created for storing the processed CTEs. When resolving an unqualified
table name, we will first traverse the list of active contexts, ie. through the list made by `parent_context`,
until matching CTE is found. Otherwise, we will use the system catalog.

### Distinctness and unique keys

The `DISTINCT` handling in the QGM paper cite above is a bit messy, so the solution proposed here differs a bit
of the one described in the paper.

As shown in the definition of `QueryBox` above, each box has a `DistinctOperation` flag, that indicates
whether the box must enforce the uniqueness of its output rows, the uniqueness is already guaranteed by the
underlying structure of the box, or the duplicated rows must be preserved in the output of the box.

Each box also exposes the sets of its columns that make unique keys on its output. A `BaseTable` instance
will contain a unique key for every unique indexes on the table. A `Select` with `DistinctOperation::Enforce`
or `DistinctOperation::Guaranteed` will have at least a unique key containing all the columns in its
projection. A `Grouping` box will have at least a unique key containing all the columns in the grouping key.

This information must be re-computed every time the underlying structure of the box is modified.

`GROUP BY` and `DISTINCT` have a different representation in QGM, where the latter is always preferred since
it makes query flattening easier. Because of that, a normalization rule will convert any `Grouping` box without
aggregate functions into a `Select` box with `DistinctOperation::Enforce`.

#### `DistinctOperation::Enforce` vs. `DistinctOperation::Guaranteed`

The following example illustrates the difference between `DistinctOperation::Enforce` and
`DistinctOperation::Guaranteed`. Consider the following scenario:

```sql
create table a(a ... primary key, ...);
create table b(b ... primary key, ...);
select * from a, b from (select distinct a from a) x, b where a = b;
```

After parsing this query we end up with a `Select` box ranging over `BaseTable` `A` with `DistinctOperation::Enforce`
projecting only column `A`, and then another `Select` box (the top-level one) ranging over that one and `BaseTable` `B`,
containing the join predicate.

One of the main goals of the normalization process is to reduce the number of boxes and flatten the query as much as possible.
Given two nested `Select` boxes, it will always try to merge them. However, in general `DistinctOperation::Enforce`
prevents a child `Select` box into a parent one, unless certain conditions that ensure the semantic correctness of the
transformation are met. One of these sufficient conditions is when the internal structure of the nested `Select` box
already guarantees the uniqueness of its output, which is indicated by `DistinctOperation::Guaranteed` flag. A
semantic transformation will analyze the internal structure of any `Select` box with `DistinctOperation::Enforce`
and will determine whether it already guarantees the uniqueness of its output.

Going back to the example above, the semantic transformation mentioned will kick in for the nested `Select` box, allowing
its merge into the top-level one. The result is a single `Select` box ranging over both base tables, which is the
representation for the following equivalent but simpler version of the query above:

```sql
select * from a, b where a = b;
```

However, following with the same example, column `A` wasn't a primary/unique key of table `A`, the distinctness of
the nested `Select` box would not be guaranteed and hence, it could not be merged into the top-level one.

### Query model transformations: query normalization stage

Some normalization transformations are better/easier done with a representation at a higher level than our current
`MirRelationExpr` representation. Specially those around SQL-specific concepts such as outer joins that are
lost during lowering. Several examples of this are [#6932](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/6932),
[#6987](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/6987) or
[#6988](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/6988), but the list of unsupported cases that are
hard to support at the moment is much longer.

### Query decorrelation during normalization

Consider the following two equivalent queries:

```
materialize=> explain select * from t1, lateral (select count(*) from t2 group by t1.f1);

Ideally, any two semantically equivalent queries should result in the same execution plan: the most optimal one
for obtaining/computing the desired results. However, after lowering the first query above, we are not able to
detect that the grouping key is constant wrt the input of the aggregation and can then be removed, reducing the
complexity of the resulting dataflow as shown in the plan for the second query, where the transformation has been
manually applied. A `RemoveConstantKeys` normalization rule applied to the query graph could easily detect
any grouping key item that is constant wrt the input of the `Grouping` box and remove it.

Another example, among the long list of them, is the one below:


```sql
create table a(a, b); create table b(c, d); create unique index bc on b(c);
select a from a where a = (select d from b where c = a.b);
select a from a, b where a = d and c = b;
```

A `ScalarToForeach` normalization rule could convert the `Scalar` subquery quantifier into a `Foreach`
quantifier since the subquery contains an equality predicate on a unique key of its input (table `b`) and
the `NULL` value returned when the subquery is empty is rejected by the equality predicate.

With a small set of normalization transformations applied on the high level representation of the query, before
lowering it, we could easily fix many cases like the ones listed above. These transformations could be used to
decorrelate some, if not all, cases where the query can be expressed with equivalent non-correlated SQL. The big
hammer used in `lowering.rs` will then be used for everything else that cannot be expressed with valid SQL in
a decorrelated manner (for example, a correlated lateral non-preserving side of an outer join cannot be decorrelated
in SQL since no predicate can cross the non-preserving boundary).

### Recursive CTEs support

A recursive CTE is a CTE with a union with two branches where one of the branches references the CTE and the other
one doesn't (representing the base case). This can be easily supported by the proposed implementation. Circular
memory ownership issues are avoided by making the model own all the nodes.

Any traversal of the query graph must keep a set/bitset of visited boxes since the same box can be ranged over by
several quantifiers. The same set/bitset will prevent infinite loops/stack overflows when traversing a recursive
query.

### Testing and debuggability of the normalization transformations

The normalization transformations will be mostly tested using `datadriven` unit tests that will take raw SQL
queries as their input and a list of transformations to be applied, and will dump the content of the graph after
applying each of them. The query graph will be dumped as a `dot` graph which, once rendered, looks like the
ones in the appendix with examples.

The `dot` graph generator will also be very handy for debugging transformations. Also, for better debuggability
the rules themselves should not drive the traversal of the graph, but just make explicit the type of traversal
they require. The traversal of the graph will be driven by some external code, that could be instrumentalized for
dumping the full graph before and after applying the rule to every node of the graph. That way, by just patching
one method, we could follow step by step the evolution of a query graph as it goes through the different
transformations.

### Lowering

The lowering code will have to be modified so that it takes a Query Graph as its input.

When lowering a `Select` box we will first build the join within that box. To do so, we will first build a
dependency graph where each quantifier is connected to the quantifiers it is correlated with. We will lower
the quantifiers in dependency order, starting with the uncorrelated ones. When lowering
a correlated quantifier, we will apply its plan to the result of the sub-join of all the quantifiers it is
connected to, resulting in simpler dataflow plans for lateral joins.

The dependency graph will be built by traversing the sub-graph of the input quantifiers collecting the
column references from the current context.

Note that the lowering code will no longer produce binary joins exclusively.

After lowering the join, a `Map` operator will be added with the non-column expressions in the projection
of the box. Then, a `Projection` will be added. If the box must enforce distinctness, the corresponding
`Reduce` operator will be added. If the box has `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`/`ORDER BY` a `TopK` operator will
then be added.

### View inlining

View inlining could be implemented as a normalization rule where only non-materialized views are inlined.

We could also do the opposite: find query patterns that match existing materialized views. Furthermore,
we could even have a view compaction step where we load all the views in the system into the same model
and find common sub-expressions within it, to identify intermediate results worth materializing.

## Alternatives

<!--
// Similar to the Description section. List of alternative approaches considered, pros/cons or why they were not chosen
-->

* QGM with interior mutability, shared pointers and so on as implemented [here](https://github.com/asenac/rust-sql).
    * Making all boxes to be directly owned by the model makes recursion easier to support.
* Relational algebra representation
* Convert `MirRelationExpr` into a normalization-friendly representation with explicit `outer join` operator
  and fewer number of operators.

## Milestones

The first milestone will consist in an end-to-end prototype with support for a simple `select a from a`, including
lowering the query graph to a dataflow and `dot` graph generator.

The second milestone will add full support for joins, including lateral joins, and subqueries, including correlated
ones.

The following milestones will add support for `GROUP BY`, `UNION` and the rest of the SQL constructs currently
supported.

In parallel, after the second milestone, work could be done on introducing query normalization before lowering,
starting with the core `SelMerge` rule described in the paper.

### Appendix A: Examples

This section includes examples of how some queries look like in QGM. This visual representation will be generated
from the representation described in the previous section. Note that having a visual way of representing the query
is very helpful during query transformation development/troubleshooting.

In this visual representation, predicates referencing columns from 1 or 2 quantifiers are represented as edges
connecting the quantifiers involved in the predicate.

#### Simple `SELECT *`

![Simple SELECT *](static/qgm/simple-select-star.svg)

#### Simple `GROUP BY`

![Simple GROUP BY](static/qgm/simple-group-by.svg)


#### `GROUP BY + HAVING`

![GROUP BY + HAVING](static/qgm/simple-group-by-having.svg)

Note that the having filter is just a regular predicate on the `Select` box ranging over the `Grouping` box.

#### `GROUP BY` vs. `DISTINCT`

As mentioned above, `GROUP BY` and `DISTINCT` use different representation in QGM. The following diagram
shows a simple `DISTINCT` query.

![DISTINCT](static/qgm/simple-distinct.svg)

As shown below, the equivalent `GROUP BY` query is automatically converted into the query graph above
during the normalization process.

![GROUP BY DISTINCT before normalization](static/qgm/group-by-distinct-before.svg)

![GROUP BY DISTINCT after normalization](static/qgm/group-by-distinct-after.svg)

#### Comma join

![Simple comma join](static/qgm/simple-comma-join.svg)

#### Inner join

![Simple inner join](static/qgm/simple-inner-join.svg)

Note that the inner join above is semantically equivalent to the comma join in the previous example. Boxes 1 and 2
represent the binary inner joins in the query, but they can be squashed into box 0, without altering the results of
the query. In fact, the normalization step will simplify this query leaving it exactly as the one in the example above:

![Simple inner join after normalization](static/qgm/simple-inner-join-after-normalization.svg)

#### Outer join

![Simple left join](static/qgm/simple-left-join.svg)

![Simple right join](static/qgm/simple-right-join.svg)

Note that in QGM there is no join direction, so left and right joins have the same exact representation. Only the type
of the quantifiers change its order.

Representing outer joins as explicit boxes goes against the goal of removing any sense of direction or join order
from the query graph. For example, the following two queries are semantically equivalent but they lead to different
query models where the join ordering is implied. We could add a normalization rule that always pushes inner joins
through the preserving side of an outer join, assuming that it is always better to do inner joins first.

![join](static/qgm/outer-inner-join.svg)
![join](static/qgm/inner-outer-join.svg)

However, we would still have the explicit join ordering issue if both joins in the query above where outer joins.
To fix that issue, normalization will lift the preserving quantifier of an outer join to the parent `Select`
making it a `Foreach` quantifier, leaving the `OuterJoin` box with just a `Foreach` quantifier, which
will represent a special potentially-correlated operator that produces a `NULL` row if none of the rows
produced by its input matches the predicate. With this normalization, the query mentioned above will look as
follows:

![join](static/qgm/normalized-outer-joins.svg)

#### Cross join

A `CROSS JOIN` can be represented as a `Select` box with no predicates as shown below:

![Simple cross join](static/qgm/simple-cross-join.svg)

#### CTEs

![Simple CTE](static/qgm/simple-cte.svg)

Quantifiers 2 and 3 are ranging over the same box, which represents the CTE. Box 2 doesn't alter the results of
box 0, but just adds aliases for the columns, for name resolution purposes. Normalization will get rid of all
the intermediate `Select` boxes, leaving the query as follows:

![Simple CTE after normalization](static/qgm/simple-cte-after-normalization.svg)

#### Lateral joins

A `LATERAL` join is just a join where one of its operands is correlated with the remaining ones, ie. a sub-graph
containing column references from quantifiers belonging in the parent context. For instance, in the following
example quantifier 4 is correlated within box 0, since its sub-graph references a column from quantifier 0 which
belongs in box 0. This correlation is made explicit by the edge going from Q1 in box 2 to Q0 in box 0.

![Lateral join](static/qgm/lateral-join.svg)

We will see later how we could decorrelate a query like that via transformations of the query model.

#### `NATURAL` joins

`NATURAL` joins don't have an explicit representation in QGM since, like `LATERAL`, it is a name resolution concept
that doesn't make sense anymore after it.

#### Subqueries

##### `EXISTS` and `IN SELECT`

`EXISTS` and `IN SELECT` subqueries are represented via `Existential` quantifiers. In fact, `EXISTS` subqueries
are represented as `1 IN (SELECT 1 FROM (<exists subquery>))` as shown in the second example below.

![IN SELECT](static/qgm/simple-in-select.svg)

![EXISTS](static/qgm/simple-exists.svg)

Given that the two queries above are equivalent, the normalization process should normalize both to the same
representation.

##### Scalar subqueries

![Scalar subquery](static/qgm/simple-scalar-subquery.svg)

Scalar subqueries are represented via `Scalar` quantifiers as shown above. These quantifiers can be converted into
regular `Foreach` quantifiers iff the inner subquery is guaranteed to always return one row at most and the NULL
value returned when the subquery is empty is ignored. Otherwise, no predicate can cross the boundary of a `Scalar`
quantifier.

##### `ANY`/`ALL` subqueries

`ANY`/`ALL` subqueries are represented via `Any` and `All` quantifier types respectively.

![ALL](static/qgm/subquery-all.svg)
![ANY](static/qgm/subquery-any.svg)

#### `VALUES`

![VALUES](static/qgm/simple-values.svg)

![VALUES with alias](static/qgm/simple-values-with-alias.svg)

In the example above, an extra box is added for the simple purpose of storing the column aliases. This extra box
is merged into the top-level one during the normalization process by the `SelMerge` rule described in the paper.

#### `UNION`

![UNION](static/qgm/simple-union.svg)
