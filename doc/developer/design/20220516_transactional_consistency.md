# Materialize Transactional Consistency

## Summary

A description of Materializeâ€™s consistency guarantees with respect to the operations that occur inside of Materialize.
Operations include: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements (but not `TAIL`)

This design document is in service of [Epic #11631](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/11631)
and [Correctness Property #1](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/blob/main/doc/developer/platform/ux.md#correctness)
(copied below).

> *Transactions in Materialize are strictly serializable with respect to the operations that occur inside of Materialize.* Operations include:
> - `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements (but not `TAIL`)
> - Materialize initiated acknowledgements of upstream sources (*e.g., the commit of an offset by a Kafka source, the acknowledge of an LSN by a PostgresSQL source, etcetera*)

This document does not take any opinion on whether the changes proposed should be the default behavior or an opt-in
behavior via some configuration.

Time units of milliseconds are used below for convenience to reflect current implementations. However, this document
does not take any opinion on what time units should be used for the design proposed.

## Goals

The goal of this design document is to describe what changes are needed to provide Strict Serializability to the
operations mentioned in correctness property 1.

## Non-Goals

Sinks are left out of this document and not considered for consistency.

`TAIL` is left out of this document and not considered for consistency.

`AS OF` allows clients to specify the timestamp of a query. Queries with `AS OF` do not constrain the timestamp
selection of other queries. These properties allow clients to circumvent our consistency guarantees, so `AS OF` is left
out of this document.

## Description

Strict Serializability (in simplified terms) means that you can assign a total order to all transactions in the system,
and that the total order is constrained by the real time occurrences of those transactions. In other words, if
transaction A finishes in real time before transaction B starts in real time, then transaction A MUST be ordered before
transaction B in the total order. Concurrent transaction can be ordered arbitrarily. For a more in depth discussion
please
read [https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/strict-serializable](https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/strict-serializable)
and chapters 7 and 9 of [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/).

Materialize can satisfy the constraints of Strict Serializability if all reads and writes occur at specific timestamps,
and these timestamps are non-decreasing in real-time order, with strict increases for writes following reads. Each
timestamp is assigned to an event at some real-time moment within the event's bounds (its start and stop). Each
timestamp transition is made durable before any subsequent response is issued.

We can then use these timestamp to form a total order constrained by real time:

- Transaction T1 is ordered before Transaction T2 if the timestamp of T1 < the timestamp of T2.
- Transaction T1 is ordered before Transaction T2 if the timestamp of T1 == the timestamp of T2, T1 is write-only, and
  T2 is read-only.
- Transaction T1 can be arbitrarily ordered with Transaction T2 if the timestamp of T1 == the timestamp of T2, T1 is
  read-only, and T2 is read-only.
- Transaction T1 can be arbitrarily ordered with Transaction T2 if the timestamp of T1 == the timestamp of T2, T1 is
  write-only, and T2 is write-only.

### Global Timestamp

All reads to any object and all writes to user tables are assigned a timestamp by the Coordinator on a single thread.
The logic for determining what timestamp to return must satisfy:

- If it's a read, then it is larger than or equal to the `since` of all objects involved in the query.
- If it's a write, then it is larger than or equal to the `upper` of the table.
- It is larger than or equal to the global timestamp
- It is larger than or equal to the timestamp of the most recently completed query.
    - If the query is a write and the most recently completed query was a read, then the timestamp returned must be
      strictly larger than the previous timestamp.

If some operation is given timestamp `ts`, then once that operation completes the global timestamp must be larger than
or equal to `ts`. How this specific property is achieved for reads is described
in [Read Capabilities on Global Timestamp](#Read Capabilities on Global Timestamp) and how it's achieved for writes is
described in [Group Commit/Write Coalesce](#Group Commit/Write Coalesce).

The properties described in this section are sufficient to ensure Strict Serializability across one start of
Materialize (i.e. not between restarts).

- [X] All reads and writes occur at specific timestamps: satisfied by the Coordinator assigning timestamps to all
  operations.
- [X] These timestamps are non-decreasing in real-time order: all timestamps are assigned sequentially on a single
  thread. Each timestamp is guaranteed to be larger than or equal to the timestamp of the most recently completed query.
- [X] With strict increases for writes following reads: the global timestamp explicitly increases after all writes (
  See [Group Commit/Write Coalesce](#Group Commit/Write Coalesce)).
- [X] Each timestamp is assigned to an event at some real-time moment within the event's bounds: For any two events e1
  and e2, if e2 starts after e1 finished, then e2's timestamp will be larger or equal timestamp than e1's timestamp.
- [X] Each timestamp transition is made durable before any subsequent response is issued: writes wait for an `append`
  command to be processed before returning a response to the client.
    - NOTE: There is ongoing work to ensure that an `append` command doesn't return until it is durable.

### Global Timestamp Recovery

After a restart the Coordinator must reestablish the global timestamp to some value greater than or equal to the value
of the previous global timestamp before the restart. This ensures that a read or write after the restart is assigned a
timestamp greater than or equal to all reads and writes before the restart.

For an initial implementation the Coordinator will record all global timestamps in the catalog. On restart the
Coordinator can read this value from the catalog.

TODO: better implementation.

The properties described in this section and the [Global Timestamp](#Global Timestamp) section are sufficient to ensure
Strict Serializability across restarts.

### Group Commit/Write Coalesce

Write read cycles (write followed by read followed by write followed by read etc) and consecutive writes can cause the
global timestamp to increase in an unbounded fashion.

Proposal: All writes across all sessions should be blocked and added to a queue. At the end of X millisecond all pending
writes are sent in a batch to STORAGE and committed together at the same timestamp. The commits are all assigned the
current global write timestamp. No reads should be served while the writes are committing.

NOTE: The `TimestampOracle` provides us the property that the global write timestamp will be higher than all previous
reads.

This approach limits the per session write throughput to 1 write transaction per X milliseconds for user tables.

This approach guarantees that when a write completes, the global timestamp is larger than or equal the timestamp of that
write. Also, when a write completes, all previous writes and reads were at a lower timestamp than the write.

NOTE: If the client had multiple writes to a single table known ahead of time, then grouping them in a single
multi-statement write transaction would increase throughput. There may be some user education needed for this.

NOTE: This would also fix the problem discussed in [#12198](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/12198).

### Read Capabilities on Global Timestamp

Proposal: Explicitly hold read capabilities for the global timestamp for all sources. All reads are assigned a timestamp
equal to the global timestamp.

Periodically the Coordinator will need to update the read capabilities to the current global timestamp. As the interval
between read capability updates increase, the memory usage of each node goes up and the communication between each node
goes down, and vice versa.

This approach guarantees that when a read completes, the global timestamp is equal to or larger than the timestamp of
that read.

### Upstream Source Acknowledgements

To achieve strict serializability of acknowledgements of upstream sources, acknowledgements should behave the same as a
write transaction. The data being acknowledged is the write of the transaction and the acknowledgement is the commit.
Materialize therefore must satisfy the following properties:

1. If data with a timestamp `ts` has been acknowledged, then all reads must have a timestamp greater than or equal
   to `ts`.
2. If data with a timestamp `ts` has not been acknowledged, then no read can have a timestamp greater than or equal
   to `ts`.

Property 1 prevents the following scenario: a client goes to an upstream source and sees that some data has been
acknowledged by Materialize but then can't see that data in Materialize.

Property 2 prevents the following scenario: a client sees some data in Materialize, but doesn't see that it's been
acknowledged in an upstream source.

This guarantee is actually too strong for our needs and has very negative availability ramifications. Once an
acknowledgement has been sent by Materialize, then no reads can be serviced until the upstream source has confirmed that
it has received our acknowledgement. Before the confirmation, Materialize has no way of knowing if the acknowledgement
has been received, and any timestamp selected for a read will be susceptible to one of the negative scenarios described
above. This means is that if any upstream source is unresponsive to an acknowledgement, then all reads will be halted
until that source is responsive again.

Property 1 alone is still a useful property, because property 1 allows us to provide guarantees like the following: A
client is using synchronous replication with an upstream source. When their transaction commits in the upstream source,
they are guaranteed to also be able to see the transaction in Materialize. However, they may actually see the
transaction in Materialize before their transaction commits in the upstream source. This is still a powerful and useful
guarantee to provide. Therefore, we should remove the second bullet point from the correctness property and instead add
the following correctness property:
> Any write from an upstream source that has been acknowledged by Materialize will be visible in all future queries.

Proposal: When STORAGE wants to acknowledge some data that has a timestamp `ts`, it must wait until it knows that the
global timestamp is larger than or equal to `ts`. STORAGE can discover this by one of the following ways (NOTE: these
aren't separate proposals, they can all work together):

- STORAGE will send an `ACK` request to the Coordinator timestamped with `ts`. The Coordinator will wait for the global
  timestamp to advance to `ts` and then send a response back to STORAGE indicating that it's OK to send the
  acknowledgement.
- If STORAGE receives a read that doesn't use `AS OF`, is in the same timeline as the data being acknowledged, and has a
  timestamp larger than or equal to `ts`, then it knows that the global timestamp must have advanced to `ts` or greater,
  and it's safe to send the acknowledgement.
- If STORAGE receives an updated Read Capability for the global timestamp (see
  [Read Capabilities on Global Timestamp](#Read Capabilities on Global Timestamp)) larger than or equal to `ts`, then it
  knows that the global timestamp must have advanced to `ts` or greater, and it's safe to send the acknowledgement.

NOTE: There are some race conditions here such as:

1. STORAGE sends an ACK request for `ts` to the Coordinator.
2. STORAGE receives a read at `ts`.
3. STORAGE sends the ACK for `ts` to an upstream source.
4. STORAGES receives ACK OK response from the Coordinator.

This is fine and STORAGE can just ignore the ACK OK response.

## Alternatives

- We don't hold read capabilities at the global timestamp. Instead, we block all queries that require a timestamp larger
  than the global timestamp until the global timestamp advances to the timestamp of that
  query. [#11150](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/11150)
  and [#10173](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/10173) are previous pull requests that try and
  implement this query blocking.
- If we didn't hold read capabilities, then we could always advance the global timestamp to the timestamp of most recent
  operation. Any operation on objects that haven't caught up to the global timestamp must be blocked until the object
  catches up to the global timestamp.
- Instead of explicitly holding read capabilities at the global timestamp, the Coordinator can include the current
  global timestamp in every message sent to dataflow nodes. The nodes would then prevent compaction up to the most
  recently seen global timestamp. After the node learns of a new timestamp they can allow compaction of every object up
  to the new timestamp. However, if a node doesn't receive any messages from the Coordinator then memory usage will
  balloon up until it hears from the Coordinator again.
- Instead of using group commit/write coalesce, the coordinator could buffer all writes to user tables in a durable
  write ahead log. All writes to user tables that occur in the same millisecond can be assigned the same timestamp, as
  long as there are no reads in-between them. Then at the end of the millisecond, or after X milliseconds, all writes
  are sent to STORAGE in a batch. If Materialize crashes/restarts before sending the writes to STORAGE, then it can just
  read the unsent writes from the durable logs after starting back up. This prevents us from having to increment the
  global timestamp on every write to a user table. However, this does not solve the problem if there are reads
  in-between the writes or if we read from a view that's ahead of the wall clock.
- Hybrid Logical Timestamps (HLT) are timestamps where the X most significant bits are used for the epoch and the Y
  least significant bits are used for a counter. Every clock tick the X bits are increased by 1 and the Y bytes are all
  reset to 0. Every write increments the Y bits by 1. This would allow us to have 2^Y writes per clock tick per object,
  without blocking any queries. Any write in excess of 2^Y per clock tick per object must be blocked until the next
  clock tick. This way no object's `upper` would have to advance past the current global timestamp if the global
  timestamp tracked the wall clock. CockroachDB uses similar timestamps
  here: https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/711ccb5b8fba4e6a826ed6ba46c0fc346233a0f7/pkg/sql/sem/builtins/builtins.go#L8548-L8560

## Open Questions

- This document does not go into great detail on how crashes/restarts in the middle of an operation affect consistency.
  All read and write operations are atomic and idempotent so crashing/restarting will not leave the system in an
  intermediate or invalid state due to read/writes. However, DDLs are not idempotent or atomic. What happens if the
  system crashes in the middle of DDL? Some of this is being thought about by the command reconciliation work.
