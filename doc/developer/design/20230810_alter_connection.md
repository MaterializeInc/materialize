# `ALTER CONNECTION`

-   Associated:
    -   https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/17620

## Context

A `CONNECTION` must be valid for a source to ingest data--however, in our
current scheme, `CONNECTION`s are immutable so any change to the service hosting
the source permanently wedges the source in Materialize. This is undesirable
because the `DROP`/`CREATE` cycle for a source can be very painful for users
because of rehydration.

## Goals

Allow users to modify a `CONNECTION` s/t they can repair the TCP connection
between MZ and their services.

## Non-Goals

Allow users to meticulously control their sources' state changes.

## Overview

We can perform a process similar to `ALTER SOURCE` wherein we update some state
in memory, re-plan something, update it in the catalog, and then communicate the
updated state throughout the system.

## Detailed description

1. Parse `ALTER CONNECTION <name> AS (KAFKA|POSTGRES) SET <option> =? <val>`.
    - In parsing `AS` clause dictates the options available. These will get
      unified in an enum that passes from parsing into planning.
1. During planning/purification:
    1. Check if `AS` clause matches existing connection type.
    1. Perform connection validation using same logic as `CREATE CONNECTION`.
1. During sequencing:

    1. Load the connection in memory. Update its values.
    1. Re-plan the value to get its updated `CREATE CONNECTION` string, just as
       we do for `ALTER SOURCE`.
    1. Commit a catalog update op for the connection.
    1. Find all sources that use the connection and update their ingestion
       description to use the new connection. I believe this only needs to be
       done to the in-memory version of the `SOURCE` because the on-disk
       representation only contains the connection details by name.
    1. To the storage controller, send a `RunIngestion` command with the new,
       in-memory representation of the ingestion.

        This will restart all of the sources with the new connection state.

## Alternatives

-   `ALTER SOURCE...SET CONNECTION` would let us swap out one connection object
    for another. This would let users create new connections, validate that they
    work, and then swap them over one-by-one.

    The advantage here is being able to more meticulously control the state
    changes sources encounter. The downside is that it has to be done
    meticulously, source-by-source and cannot change all sources using this
    connection at once.

## Unexpected corners + derivations from original design

The original design overlooked that:

-   Connection states were stored in memory and updating them would be
    challenging. To handle this, we only place the connection states in memory
    when they are about to be shipped off to storage. In the code, this is
    `into_inline_connection`.
-   Sinks would need to be restarted, which was not something we had done before.
-   We had to resolve #20019 before we could restart sinks.

Derivations:

-   We decided to allow users to type `ALTER CONNECTION` with specifying the
    source type, which meant that we had to associate connection settings with
    source types in planning rather than in the parser.
-   Users might want to change multiple settings transactionally, so we also
    added the `DROP` and `RESET` options, as well as let users provide a list of
    changes.
-   We needed to surround the options names and new values in parens for
    syntactic similarity with other option-handling statements.
