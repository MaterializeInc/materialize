MIR is typechecked using user-facing SQL types.
SQL types make distinctions between types (e.g., `CHAR(5)`, `VARCHAR(5)`, and `TEXT`) that will not be realized at runtime (all of these are represented using `Datum::String`).

This design doc proposes _representation types_---a new notion of type for MIR terms.
A representation type maps to a subset of constructors/variants of the `Datum` enum.

Making this change should help address issues in optimization, particularly index selection (see ["The Problem"](#the-problem)).
It will also simplify and clarify what MIR is doing.

## The Problem

[Postgres has several types for character data:](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-character.html)

- `char(n)`, `bpchar(n)` for fixed-length strings with a fixed-length representation (whitespace padded)
- `varchar(n)` for fixed-length strings with a variable-length representation
- `varchar` for arbitrary-length strings with a variable-length representation
- `bpchar` for arbitrary-length strings with a variable-length representation where trailing whitespace is trimmed
- `text` for arbitrary-length strings with a variable-length representation

(There are also `"char"` and `name`, but they are very much internal to Postgres---let's ignore them for the moment.)

Materialize implements all five of these character sequence types using `Datum::String`.
Materialize only implements meaningful operations on the `text` type; to operate on other character sequence types, one must convert to `text`.
Conversion to `text` is a no-op at runtime, since we already have the string.
We freely insert implicit coercions to `text` in the early stages of query processing.
For correct error behavior, however, we need to carefully keep track of failures to meet length limits.

These implicit coercions---often of the form `varchar_to_text(#c)` for some column number `c`---get in the way during join planning.
Even if we have an index on column `c` as a `varchar`, we cannot use that index to plan a join on `varchar_to_text(#c)`: not only are the types different, the terms are different, too.
We know these implicit coercions interfere with joins; they may also interfere with other aspects of optimization.

## Success Criteria

1. Plan joins and fast-path index lookups without implicit coercions between equivalent representation types getting in the way.
2. It should be possible for us to elide noop casts (and possibly others!) at the MIR level.
3. The catalog should reflect SQL-level types.
4. There is clear guidance for customers regarding the different character sequence types.
5. Notices help customers avoid pitfalls with character sequence types.

## Out of Scope

We will not rethink other components of MIR types, like nullability or unique keys.

We will not simplify our representation of numbers or reconsider numeric types.

In general, we may want a "smart index selector", which can appropriately handle mixed-type lookups, i.e., it should let us look up an `i32` in an `i64`-sized index without needing to build a separate `i32`-sized arrangement. Such an approach generalizes `eq-indx` (see ["Alternatives"](#alternatives)).

## Solution Proposal

Having MIR be typechecked in terms of representation types demands a few changes, which can be broken into three PRs:

1. Rename the existing `ScalarType` to `SqlScalarType`. (We may want to add a `Sql` prefix to `ColumnType` and `RelationType`, as well.)
2. Have MIR work with `ReprScalarType`.
   a. Introduce the `ReprScalarType` datatype (see [MVP](#minimal-viable-prototype)).
   b. Change the optimizer to work with `ReprScalarType` throughout.
   c. Change the adapter to record the `SqlScalarType` of a query and update its nullability information using the `ReprScalarType` at the end of optimization.
3. Elide noop casts, confirming that we plan the problematic joins better.

PR #2 will have a large diff.
On the plus side, it should be a largely mechanical change: there is a straightforward way to project a `SqlScalarType` to a `ReprScalarType`, and most uses of types in the optimizer will be parametric.

## Minimal Viable Prototype

The representation types will look like the following:

```rust
pub enum ReprScalarType {
    Bool,
    Int16,
    Int32,
    Int64,
    UInt8, // also includes SqlScalarType::PgLegacyChar
    UInt16,
    UInt32, // also includes SqlScalarType::{Oid,RegClass,RegProc,RegType}
    UInt64,
    Float32,
    Float64,
    Numeric,
    Date,
    Time,
    Timestamp {
        precision: Option<TimestampPrecision>,
    },
    TimestampTz {
        precision: Option<TimestampPrecision>,
    },
    MzTimestamp,
    Interval,
    Bytes,
    Jsonb,
    String, // also includes SqlScalarType::{VarChar,Char,PgLegacyName}
    Uuid,
    Array(Box<ReprScalarType>),
    Int2Vector, // differs from Array enough to stick around
    List {
        element_type: Box<ReprScalarType>,
    },
    Record {
        fields: Box<[ReprColumnType]>,
    },
    Map {
        value_type: Box<ReprScalarType>,
    },
    Range {
        element_type: Box<ReprScalarType>,
    },
    MzAclItem,
    AclItem,
}

pub struct ReprColumnType {
    pub scalar_type: ReprScalarType,
    pub nullable: bool,
}
```

Since LIR is effectively untyped, there's no need for us to define `LirScalarType` or the like. We already use `MirScalarExpr` inside of `Mfp`s in LIR.

We'll need to define a projection from `SqlScalarType` to `ReprScalarType` (see [`ScalarType::is_instance_of()`](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/blob/e4578164fb28a204b43c58ab8ff6c1d3e3b4427f/src/repr/src/scalar.rs#L947) for the correspondence).

In `EXPLAIN PLAN`s, we will report `ReprScalarType`s with `r`-prefixed names, where `r` is short for "representation", e.g., `rstring` is the `ReprScalarType` corresponding to `text`, `varchar`, etc.

### What changes?

  - Rename `ScalarType` to `SqlScalarType`; ditto `ColumnType` and `RelationType`.
  - Introduce `ReprScalarType` and a corresponding `ReprColumnType` and (possibliy) `ReprRelationType`. Add a `From` instance to compile `Sql*` types to `Repr*` types.

These first two steps are in [#33321](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/33321).

  - Adapt `MirScalarExpr`, `MirRelationExpr`, `PlanNode`, and LIR `Expr` to use `ReprColumnType`.
    + `TableFunc` uses `ScalarType`. We can split into `Sql` and `Repr` versions, or have it take the type as a parameter.
    + `AggregateFunc` is already split; the `expr` crate's `MapAgg` can use `ReprScalarType`.
    + `UnaryFunc` doesn't take any type arguments.
    + `BinaryFunc::RangeContainsElem` changes to use `ReprScalarType`.
    + `VariadicFunc` uses `ScalarType`. We can split it or parameterize it (likely better).
  - Several transforms need to change.
    * Parametric (used for arity or equality)
      + `optimize_dataflow_demand`
      + `demand`
      + `reduction_pushdown`
      + `redundant_join`
      + `union_cancel`
      + `anf`
      + `projection_lifting`
      + `projection_pushdown`
    * Real reasoning
      + `column_knowledge`
      + `join implementation` (needs keys)
      + `literal_constraints`
      + `non_null_requirements` (nullability only)
      + `normalize_lets` (parametric except for nullability)
      + `predicate_pushdown` (calls `MSE::reduce` and `canonicalize_equivalences` and `canonicalize_predicates`)
      + `semijoin_idempotence` (nullability only)
      + `fusion::filter` (calls `canonicalize_predicates`)
      + `typecheck` (quelle surprise)
      + the `RelationType` analysis (ibid.)
  - `AvailableCollections` could be split or parameterized---or its users can use the `From` instance to deal with `Repr` types.
  - Some `EXPLAIN` infrastructure would have to be updated to emit representation types.
  - `StatementDesc` and `RelationDesc` will stay in the SQL-typed world.

Followup PRs will need to resolve the reamining bullet points; we can do this in a variety of orders.

### What would it look like to address nullability at the same time?

The catalog tracks nullability, and it would be a major change to no longer do so. But we can stop tracking that kind of information as types in the optimizer itself.

The "real reasoning" transforms above (and a few others) use type-based nullability information (`analysis`, `column_knowledge`, `equivalence_propagation`, `fold_constants`, `literal_constraints`, `non_null_requirements`, `predicate_pushdown`, `semijoin_idempotence`, `typecheck`, `equivalences`, `filter`), and would need to be updated.

Quite a few things in `expr` would need to change: the abstract interperet, all kinds of MRE and MSE methods, lots of binary and variadic ffunc methods. Notably we would _not_ be updating `output_types`, which should produce `Sql` types, not `Repr` types.

## Alternatives

We considered several alternatives:

- (`eq-type`) Change the MIR typechecker to conflate `varchar` and `text` types (and drop calls to `varchar_to_text`).
- (`eq-indx`) Change index selection to conflate `varchar` and `text` types (and leave calls to `varchar_to_text`).
- (`remixvc`) Automatically turn add `varchar_to_text` to all indices on a `varchar`.
- (`remix++`) Automatically wrap every use of a `varchar` with `varchar_to_text`.

The `eq-type` and `eq-indx` approach came up in early discussions.
These are fundamentally hacks, with the upside of being quick fixes.
The downside is the addition of a tricky corner case, some risk (what if keeping the types separate matters somewhere we've forgotten about?), and some technical debt/mess-making.

The `remixvc` and `remix++` approaches address the problem at the user/adapter side.
Such rewriting feels a bit risky/annoying/confusing, and I'm not sure how it would interact with sources.

## Open questions

It's possible that (as Nikhil worries) somewhere in the pgwire or WS layers calls `.typ()` on a `MirRelationExpr` and expects a `SqlScalarType` but will now find a `ReprScalarType`.
I don't know those layers well, but we could derisk some of the work of PR #2 by checking for that in advance.
(In any case, the Rust type checker will be eager to tell us about it.)
