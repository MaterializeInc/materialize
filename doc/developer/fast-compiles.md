# Fast compiles

This document attempts to capture the various lessons learned by Materialize
engineers when optimizing machines for compiling Rust.

## Run Linux

The most important step you can take to speed up Rust compilation times is to
run Linux rather than macOS.

First, your money goes much farther if you don't pay the Apple tax. For a given
price point, you can usually build a Linux machine with twice as much compute,
memory, and storage than a Mac.

Second, the linkers on Linux are faster. Apple has not invested much in speeding
up `ld` on macOS, and there are no alternatives. On Linux, you have your choice
of three production-grade linkers: the standard `ld` (bfd), gold, and lld. lld
in particular is blazing fast.

Finally—and this is somewhat of an aside—a Linux machine will allow you to run
performance tests on your laptop. Our customer's production deployments are
running on Linux, not macOS. While it's possible to get a rough sense of
Materialize's performance on macOS, there have been more than a few occasions
where apparent perfomance defects have disappeared when running the workload on
Linux.

### Use lld

On Linux, using lld instead of the standard linker will result in an impressive
linking speedup. You can install it from the standard package repository on
Debian-based distributions:

```shell
sudo apt install lld
```

You'll need to hunt down the equivalent instructions for your distribution if
you don't use a Debian-based distribution.

Then, tell Rust to use lld by setting the following environment variable:

```shell
export RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"
```

Ideally, set that in your `~/.bashrc` or equivalent so that it applies
permanently.

## Example custom builds

The easiest way to speed up compilation is to throw some money at faster
hardware. A few Materialize employees have embarked on this quest so far:

  * Nikhil built a 3970x-based desktop in spring 2020.
    See: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/LWnRyk

  * Sean built a nearly identical desktop in summer 2020.

  * Matt is building a 5950x-based desktop as soon as 5950x CPUs
    are not out of stock (early 2021).
    See: https://pcpartpicker.com/user/mjibson/saved/Wp4fvK

  * Eli is building a similar desktop to Matt (early 2021).
    See: https://pcpartpicker.com/user/elindsey_/saved/BnTk99

The jury is still out on whether more, slower cores (e.g., 3970x) is better than
less, faster cores (e.g., 5950x) for the standard `cargo build` development
cycle.

To date, no one has attempted to build a Linux laptop optimized for compilation
performance.

## Community resources

Many folks in the Rust community have tips too. Some of those are collected
here:

  * The [Compile Times][nethercote] chapter of Nicholas Nethercote's *The Rust
    Performance Book*.

  * Brian Anderson's [The Rust Compilation Model Calamity][brson] blog post,
    published on PingCAP's blog. The blog post is the start of an ongoing series
    about compile times in Rust.

  * Matthias Endler's [Tips for Faster Rust Compile Times][endler].
