# Developer guide: testing

This guide details our testing philosophy, as well as how to run the test
suites.

## Overview

There are broadly three test suites:

  1. The Rust **unit/integration test suite**, which is run by `cargo test`.
     These live alongside the code they test in a `mod tests { ... }` block, or
     in the `tests/` directory within a crate.

  2. The data-driven **system test suite** in the top-level [test/](/test)
     directory. These consist of text files in various DSLs (sqllogictest,
     testdrive, pgtest) that essentially specify SQL commands to run and
     their expected output.

  3. The long-running **performance and stability test suite**. This test suite
     has yet to be automated. At the moment it consists of engineers manually
     running the demo in [demo/chbench/](/demo/chbench).

The unit/integration and system test suites are run on every PR and can easily
be run locally. The goal is for these test suites to be quite fast, ideally
under 10m, while still catching 95% of bugs.

The long-running tests will simulate actual production runs of Materialize on
gigabytes to terabytes of data over several hours to days, and will therefore
report their results asynchronously (perhaps nightly or weekly).

Details about each of the test suites follow.

## Unit/integration tests

The unit/integration test suite uses the standard test framework that ships with
Cargo. You can run the full test suite like so:

```shell
$ cargo test
```

Some of the packages have tests that depend on ZooKeeper, Kafka, and the
Confluent Schema Registry running locally on the default ports. See the
[Developer guide](guide.md) for full details on setting this up, but
the following will do the trick if you have the Confluent Platform 5.3+ CLI
installed and configured:

```shell
$ confluent local services schema-registry start
```

`cargo test` supports many options for precisely controlling what tests get
run, like `--package CRATE`, `--lib`, `--doc`. See its documentation for the
full details.

Two arguments bear special mention.

The first is the `--nocapture` argument, which tells Cargo not to hide the
output of successful test runs:

```shell
$ cargo test -- --nocapture
```

Notice how the `--nocapture` argument appears after a `--` argument. This is not
a typo. This is how you pass an argument to the test binary itself, rather than
to Cargo. This syntax might be a bit confusing at first, but it's used
pervasively throughout Cargo, and eventually you get used to it. (It's also the
POSIX-blessed syntax for indicating that you want option parsing to stop, so you
might be familiar with it from other command-line tools.)

Without `--nocapture`, `println!()` and `dbg!()` output from tests can go
missing, making debugging a very frustrating experience.

The second argument worth special mention is the filter argument, which only
runs the tests that match the specified pattern. For example, to only run tests
with `avro` in their name:

```shell
$ cargo test -- avro
```

As mentioned above, the Rust unit/integration tests follow the standard
convention, and live in a `mod tests { ... }` block alongside the code
they test, or in a `tests/` subdirectory of the crate they test, respectively.

### Datadriven

[Datadriven](https://github.com/justinj/datadriven) is a tool for writing
[table-driven tests](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests) in
Rust, with rewrite support. datadriven tests plug into `cargo test` as unit
or integration tests, but store test data in separate files from the Rust code.

Datadriven is particularly useful when the output to be tested is too large to
be mantained by hand efficiently. The expected output of tests written with
datadriven can be updated by running them with the `REWRITE` environment
variable set:

 ```shell
$ REWRITE=1 cargo test
```

When using `REWRITE` it's important to inspect the diff carefully to ensure
that nothing changed unexpectedly.

For an example of what datadriven tests look like, check out
[`src/transform/tests`](/src/transform/tests).

## System tests

There are presently two system test frameworks. These are tests against with
Materialize as a whole or near-whole, and often test its interaction with other
systems, like Kafka.

### sqllogictest

The first system test framework is sqllogictest, which was developed by
the authors of SQLite to cross-check queries across various database vendors.
Here's a representative snippet from a SQLite file:

```
query I rowsort
SELECT - col2 + col1 + col2 FROM tab2
----
17
31
59
```

This snippet will verify that the query `SELECT - col2 + col1 + col2 FROM tab2`
outputs a table with one integer column (that's the `query I` bit) with the
specified results without verifying order (that's the `rowsort` bit).

For more information on how sqllogictest works, check out the official [SQLite
sqllogictest docs][sqllogictest-docs]. Note that our version of sqllogictest has
a bunch of modifications from CockroachDB and from ourselves. The SQLite docs
document what is known "mode standard". Look in the [Materialize sqllogictest
extended guide](sqllogictest.md) for additional documentation, with an emphasis
on the extensions beyond what is in the SQLite's base sqllogictest.

sqllogictest ships with a *huge* corpus of test data—something like 6+ million
queries. This takes hours to run in full, so in CI we only run a small subset
on each PR, but can schedule the full run on demand. For many features, you may
not need to write many tests yourself, if you can find an existing sqllogictest
file that has coverage of that feature! (Grep is your friend.)

We pass every SQLite test, with only a few modifications to the upstream test
data.

To run a sqllogictest against Materialize, you'll need to have PostgreSQL
running on the default port, 5432, and have created a database named after
your user. On macOS:

```shell
$ brew install postgresql
$ brew services start postgresql
$ createdb $(whoami)  # Yes, this is a shell command, not a SQL command.
```

On Debian, the current user might not exist or have sufficient permissions to
create a database. If the `createdb` command fails, try to create a local
postgres user matching the current user, with the `createdb` permission:

```shell
$ sudo -u postgres createuser "$(whoami)" --createdb
```

You might reasonably wonder why PostgreSQL is necessary for running
sqllogictests against Materialize. The answer is that we offload the hard work
of mutating queries, like `INSERT INTO ...` and `UPDATE`, to PostgreSQL. We
slurp up the changelog, much like we would if we were running against a
Kafka–PostgreSQL [CDC] solution in production, and then run the `SELECT` queries
against Materialize and verify they match the results specified by the
sqllogictest file.

Once PostgreSQL is running, you can run a sqllogictest file like so:

```shell
$ cargo run --bin sqllogictest --release -- test/sqllogictest/TESTFILE.slt
```

For larger test files, it is imperative that you compile in release mode, i.e.,
by passing the `--release` flag as above. The extra compile time will quickly be
made up for by a much faster execution.

To add logging for tests, append `-vv`, e.g.:

```shell
$ cargo run --bin sqllogictest --release -- test/TESTFILE.slt -vv
```

There are currently three classes of sqllogictest files:

  1. The offical SQLite test files are in
     [test/sqllogictest/sqlite](/test/sqllogictest/sqlite). Note that the
     directory is a git submodule, so the folder will start off as empty if you
     did not clone this repository with `--recurse-submodules`. To populate it,
     run:

     ```shell
     $ git submodule update --init
     ```

  2. Additional test files from CockroachDB are in
     [test/sqllogictest/cockroach](/test/sqllogictest/cockroach). Note that we
     certainly don't pass every Cockroach sqllogictest test at the moment.

  3. Additional Materialize-specific sqllogictest files live in
     [test/sqllogictest](/test/sqllogictest).

Feel free to add more Materialize-specific sqllogictests! Because it is more
lightweight, sqllogictest is the preferred system test framework when testing:

* the correctness of queries,
* what query plans are being generated.

In general, do not add or modify SQLite and/or CockroachDB test files because
that inhibits syncing with upstream.

### testdrive

Testdrive is a Materialize invention that feels a lot like sqllogictest, except
it supports pluggable commands for interacting with external systems, like
Kafka. It has its own [documentation page](testdrive.md).

Note that testdrive actually interacts with Materialize over the network, via
the PostgreSQL wire protocol, so it tests more of Materialize than our
sqllogictest driver does. (It would be possible to run sqllogictest over the
network too, but this is just not how things are configured at the moment.)
Therefore it's often useful to write some additional testdrive tests to make
sure things get serialized on the wire properly. For example, when adding a new
data type, like, say, `DATE`, the upstream CockroachDB sqllogictests will
provide most of the coverage, but it's worth adding some (*very*) basic
testdrive tests (e.g., `> SELECT DATE '1999-01-01'`) to ensure that our pgwire
implementation is properly serializing dates.

### pgtest

Pgtest is DSL to specify raw pgwire messages to send and their expected
responses. It can be used to test message sequences that are difficult
or impossible to test with PostgreSQL drivers. Its output is generated
against PostgreSQL and then tested against Materialize. Usage is
documented at the [pgtest crate][pgtest-docs].

## Long-running tests

These are still a work in progress. The beginning of the orchestration has
begun, though; see the Docker Compose demo in [demo/chbench](/demo/chbench) if
you're curious.

## What kind of tests should I write?

tl;dr add additional system tests, like sqllogictests and testdrive tests.

Unit/integration tests are great for complicated pure functions. A good example
is Avro decoding. Bytes go in, and `avro::Value`s come out. This is a very easy
unit test to write, and one that provides a lot of value. The Avro specification
is stable, so the behaviour of the function should never change, modulo bugs.

But unit/integration tests can be detrimental when testing stateful functions,
especially those in the middle of the stack. Trying to unit test some of the
functions in the [dataflow](/src/dataflow) package would be an exercise in
frustration. You'd need to mock out a dozen different objects and introduce
several traits, and the logic under test is changing frequently, so the test
will hamper development as often as it catches regressions.

Nikhil's philosophy is that writing a battery of system tests is a much better
use of time. Testdrive and sqllogictest have discovered numerous bugs with the
fiddly bits of timestamp assignment in the coord package, even though that's
not what they're designed for. It's true that it's much harder to ascertain what
exactly went wrong–some of these failures presented as hangs in CI—but I wager
that you still net save time by not writing overly complicated and brittle unit
tests.

As a module stabilizes and its abstraction boundaries harden, unit
testing becomes more attractive. But be wary of introducing abstraction just
to make unit tests easier to right.

And, as a general rule of thumb, you don't want to add a new long-running test.
Experience suggests that these are quite finicky (e.g., because a VM fails to
boot), never mind that they're quite slow, so they're best limited to a small
set of tests that exercise core business metrics. A long-running test should, in
general, be scheduled as a separate work item, so that it can receive the
nurturing required to be stable enough to be useful.
