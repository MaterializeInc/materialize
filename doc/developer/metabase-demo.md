# Metabase demo instructions

The purpose of this demo is to visualize Materialize queries and
highlight the ease of connecting to BI (business intelligence) tools.

The Metabase demo can be run:
- Manually on your laptop
- Using Docker
- On AWS

For now, these instructions only describe how to run the Metabase demo
with Docker, although many steps are the same between the three.

## Docker

### Starting the Docker containers and loading data

First, we use [this script](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/blob/master/demo/chbench/dc.sh)
to pull the necessary Docker images, bring containers up with Docker compose, and
load an initial set of data. To do that, we run:

```console
$ ./dc.sh up :init:
$ ./dc.sh up :demo:
```

Note: Running `up :init:` loads an initial set of TPC-CH data into Materialize.
Running `up :demo:` will  load that same data in Materialize again. In the future,
we should find a way to load data/initialize tables without creating these duplicates.

Now that the data is loaded into Materialize, we want to create sources
with it. Enter a psql shell connected to Materialize:

```console
psql -h localhost -p 6875
```

And create the sources:

```console
$ CREATE SOURCES LIKE 'mysql.tpcch.%'
  FROM 'kafka://kafka:9092' USING SCHEMA REGISTRY 'http://schema-registry:8081';
mysql_tpcch_customer
mysql_tpcch_district
mysql_tpcch_history
mysql_tpcch_item
mysql_tpcch_nation
mysql_tpcch_neworder
mysql_tpcch_order
mysql_tpcch_orderline
mysql_tpcch_region
mysql_tpcch_stock
mysql_tpcch_supplier
mysql_tpcch_warehouse
```

### Connecting Metabase to Materialize

Starting up the required Docker containers using `dc.sh` brings up the Metabase
and Materialize services. Now, we need to connect the two.

To open Metabase, go to <localhost:3030> in your browser.
You should see Metabase is already running, but needs you to
create a user and connect to a database. Note: Each time you
restart the Metabase container, you will need to create a
user and reconnect to Materialize.

In the dropdown containing a list of possible database
connections, choose `Materialize`. If you don't see `Materialize`,
check that you have a `Materialize` .jar in your Metabase's
`/plugins` directory. If not, follow steps [here](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/metabase-materialize-driver).

There are three groups of fields:
- Your metabase user:
  + Simply fill in the user information fields.

    I recommend using `mz` / `consistent1` in case you get logged out.
- In order for metabase to connect with Materialize inside our `docker-compose` cluster,
  use the following host and port information:
  + Host: `materialized`
  + Port: `6875`
- Username, and database are required but not checked (issue #1467) you can just put `mz`
  for all of them.

Next, you will either agree/disagree to send analytics back to Metabase.
You will be able to continue through either way.

You should now be able to see the main Metabase dashboard.

### Configuring Metabase

Once you have connected Metabase to Materialize and you are able to
see the main dashboard, you will want to sync the Metabase and
Materialize database schemas. To do that, you should:
1. Navigate to [`/admin/databases`](localhost:3030/admin/databases) in your browser
2. Click on the database you created
3. Click "sync database schema now" in the top right
4. Go back to the [`/`](localhost:3030/) path

Now that Metabase is connected to Materialize, we can create a demo dashboard.
To do this, you will have to:
- Create a new dashboard
- Create questions (queries) in Metabase
- Add questions to the dashboard

#### Create a new dashboard

From the `/` path, you should be able to create a dashboard by clicking the
`+` button in the top right hand corner.

#### Create questions

From the `/` path, you should be able to create a question by clicking the
"Ask a Question" button in the top right hand corner, taking you to
[`/question/new`](localhost:3030/question/new).

To demo Materialize, we have been adding two copies of a handful of
queries to a demo dashboard: one copy without a view and one copy
with a view. Note: You have to manually create these views in order
for the second query to work, either through your `psql` shell or
the Metabase interactive SQL editor.

- A Simple count:
    - Create the view:
      ```sql
      CREATE VIEW orderline_count AS
      SELECT count(*) FROM mysql_tpcch_orderline;
      ```
    - Use the view:
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM orderline_count;
      ```
    - For comparison, you can run the full query on a source once you
      have materialized it. To do so:
      ```sql
      CREATE VIEW orderline_view
      AS SELECT * FROM mysql_tpcch_orderline;
      ```
      And then running the full query on the view:
      ```sql
      SELECT count(*) FROM mysql_tpcch_orderline_view;
      ```

- Q01:
    - Create the view:
      ```sql
        CREATE VIEW q01 AS
        SELECT
            ol_number,
            sum(ol_quantity) AS sum_qty,
            sum(ol_amount) AS sum_amount,
            avg(ol_quantity) AS avg_qty,
            avg(ol_amount) AS avg_amount,
            count(*) AS count_order
        FROM mysql_tpcch_orderline
        WHERE ol_delivery_d > TIMESTAMP '2007-01-02 00:00:00.000000'
        GROUP BY ol_number
        ORDER BY ol_number;
      ```
    - Use the view:
      ```sql
        SELECT * FROM q01;
      ```
    - For comparison, you can run the full query on the underlying
      source once you have materialized it. To do so:
      ```sql
      CREATE VIEW orderline_view
      AS SELECT * FROM mysql_tpcch_orderline;
      ```
      And then running the full query on the view:
      ```sql
        SELECT
            ol_number,
            sum(ol_quantity) AS sum_qty,
            sum(ol_amount) AS sum_amount,
            avg(ol_quantity) AS avg_qty,
            avg(ol_amount) AS avg_amount,
            count(*) AS count_order
        FROM mysql_tpcch_orderline_view
        WHERE ol_delivery_d > TIMESTAMP '2007-01-02 00:00:00.000000'
        GROUP BY ol_number
        ORDER BY ol_number;
      ```

More queries can be found and added from the appendix.

#### Add questions to the dashboard

## Running the demo

An important part of this demo, and the reason we're using TPC-CH is to point out that we
are capable of running arbitrary SQL, including arbitrary joins, across arbitrary
sources. As we add more source types we will demo merging e.g. CSV and log sources with
TPC-CH seamlessly.

Go back to the "browse data" (the materialize db from `/browse`) screen, some talking
points:

* We are a streaming data engine that is capable of supporting all of SQL, with strong
  consistency guarantees. The only thing left at this point is engineering effort to add
  more features, we know that they are achievable.
* To demonstrate where we are now we're going to walk through just using a regular BI
  tool in the way that a regular analyst would use it, but then show the power of
  materialize maintaining streaming views.
* A useful example of this is to click the lightning bolt next to `Mysql Tpcch Order
  Line` just sort of to demo that we do in fact support a standard end-user analyst
  experience.

  Talking points: these are just a variety of non-join queries that we support, but the
  point is that this un-hacked BI tool just works with us, and we'll work with them to
  make sure that their BI tool of choice also works with us.
* Ask a simple question to demonstrate that we can work with the standard
  analytics interfaces.
* Then go to a pre-configured dashboard from one of the previous steps
* Then you can run the demo-load generator:

    dc.sh demo-load

* And manually reload (issue #1286) the dashboard to watch things changing.
