# mzbuild

mzbuild is an build and orchestration system for [Docker] containers.

As a user or developer, you'll interact with mzbuild through three commands:

  * [**`mzcompose`**](#mzcompose) is a thin layer on top of [Docker Compose]
    that automatically downloads cached images from Docker Hub if available, or
    otherwise builds them locally if you've made changes to the inputs of the
    image.

    This approach keeps things snappy when running a demo or test on the latest
    tip of main, while ensuring that you don't need to modify the Docker
    Compose configuration as you make changes to the source code.

  * [**`mzimage`**](#mzimage) is a lower-level command that allows inspection
    and finer-grained control over the build process for the images in the
    repository.

From the root of the repository, invoke the commands as `bin/mzcompose` and
`bin/mzimage`, respectively. Any directory with an `mzcompose.yml` file will
also have a convenience script alongside it, which you can invoke as
`./mzcompose` from within that directory.

## Tutorial

*Warning: mzbuild does not yet return particularly friendly error messages. This
is under active improvement.*

### `mzimage`

The core object of mzbuild is the Docker image. To ask mzbuild to manage a
Docker image for you, simply create a new directory in the repository with
a `Dockerfile` and a configuration file named `mzbuild.yml`.

Here's a simple example for a fictional Python load generator called
`fancy-load`:

```Dockerfile
# test/fancy/loadgen/Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu:bionic-20200403

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -qy python3

COPY fancy-loadgen.py .

ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "fancy-loadgen.py"]
```

```yml
# test/fancy/loadgen/mzbuild.yml

name: fancy-loadgen
```

```py
# test/fancy/loadgen/fancy-loadgen.py

print("fancy load")
```

That's it! mzbuild will now automatically detect this image. You can see for
yourself with the `mzimage list` command:

```shell
$ bin/mzimage list
...
fancy-loadgen
...
```

You can then also ask `mzimage` to run the image:

```shell
$ bin/mzimage run fancy-loadgen
==> Acquiring materialize/fancy-loadgen:7J7C34QTCEKQTI5G3NDIH7FFMMWZ3IWB
$ docker pull materialize/fancy-loadgen:7J7C34QTCEKQTI5G3NDIH7FFMMWZ3IWB
...
Successfully tagged materialize/fancy-loadgen:7J7C34QTCEKQTI5G3NDIH7FFMMWZ3IWB
$ docker run -it --rm --init materialize/fancy-loadgen:7J7C34QTCEKQTI5G3NDIH7FFMMWZ3IWB
fancy load
```

Notice that random string of characters, `7J7C34QTCEKQTI5G3NDIH7FFMMWZ3IWB`, in
the output? That's the image's fingerprint, which is a Base32-encoded SHA-1 hash
of the inputs to your image. By default, mzbuild assumes all files in the
image's directory are inputs, which is usually a sane default.

Don't worry if your fingerprint isn't identical. A single stray newline will
result in a completely different fingerprint.

If you run the image again, since we've already got an image for that
fingerprint available, `mzimage` won't need to rebuild the image, and the
command should be much speedier:

```shell
$ bin/mzimage run fancy-loadgen
$ docker run -it --rm --init materialize/fancy-loadgen:7J7C34QTCEKQTI5G3NDIH7FFMMWZ3IWB
fancy load
```

Now try changing the Python script to print some fancier load:

```py
import sys
sys.stdout.buffer.write("ðŸŽ© load\n".encode("utf-8"))
```

If we ask `mzimage` about the fingerprint, we'll see it's changed to reflect
the new Python code:

```shell
$ bin/mzimage fingerprint fancy-loadgen
TPOXKNHJOZBEYRN635UXLDHML6INVVMV
```

We can also add dependencies on other images to fancy-loadgen. Let's say we
also want to include the billing-demo image. Edit the Dockerfile to look like
this:

```dockerfile
# test/fancy/loadgen/Dockerfile

MZFROM billing-demo AS billing-demo

FROM ubuntu:bionic-20200403

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -qy python3

COPY fancy-loadgen.py .

COPY --from=billing-demo /usr/local/bin/billing-demo /usr/local/bin/billing-demo

CMD ["python3", "fancy-loadgen.py"]
```

And let's verify that the new image contains `billing-demo` where we expect it:

```shell
$ bin/mzimage run fancy-loadgen ls -lh /usr/local/bin/billing-demo
==> Acquiring materialize/billing-demo:FM4STU42G7W44OLAPKZNEZWGEPTMIVE6
$ docker pull materialize/billing-demo:FM4STU42G7W44OLAPKZNEZWGEPTMIVE6
FM4STU42G7W44OLAPKZNEZWGEPTMIVE6: Pulling from materialize/billing-demo
...
docker.io/materialize/billing-demo:FM4STU42G7W44OLAPKZNEZWGEPTMIVE6
==> Acquiring materialize/fancy-loadgen:LLJS6MMDVOHZJQFBP42DFBW6Z5N3CW4F
$ docker pull materialize/fancy-loadgen:LLJS6MMDVOHZJQFBP42DFBW6Z5N3CW4F
Error response from daemon: manifest for materialize/fancy-loadgen:LLJS6MMDVOHZJQFBP42DFBW6Z5N3CW4F not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
$ docker build --pull -f - -t materialize/fancy-loadgen:LLJS6MMDVOHZJQFBP42DFBW6Z5N3CW4F test/fancy/loadgen
...
Successfully tagged materialize/fancy-loadgen:LLJS6MMDVOHZJQFBP42DFBW6Z5N3CW4F

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 8.3M Apr 15 01:34 /usr/local/bin/billing-demo
```

Notice how mzbuild automatically downloaded a copy of the billing-demo from
Docker Hub! Seamless.

### `mzcompose`

To create an mzcompose configuration that uses the `fancy-loadgen` image we
built in the previous tutorial, just drop an `mzcompose.yml` file into a
directory:

```yml
version: "3.7"

services:
  fancy:
    mzbuild: fancy-loadgen
```

If you're unfamiliar with Compose, you may want to take a look at the
[Compose file reference][compose-ref] for details.

Now bring the configuration up with `bin/mzcompose`:

```shell
$ bin/mzcompose --mz-find fancy up
==> Collecting mzbuild dependencies
materialize/billing-demo:FM4STU42G7W44OLAPKZNEZWGEPTMIVE6
materialize/fancy-loadgen:Z2GPU4TQMCV2PGFTNUPYLQO2PQAYD6OY
==> Delegating to Docker Compose
Starting fancy_fancy_1 ... done
Attaching to fancy_fancy_1
fancy_1  | ðŸŽ© load
fancy_fancy_1 exited with code 0
```

The argument you pass to `--mz-find` is the name of the directory containing the
`mzcompose.yml`. Don't worry: if this directory name is not unique across the
entire repository, `mzcompose` will complain.

Notice how `mzcompose` automatically acquired images for not just
`fancy-loadgen` but all of its dependencies before delegating to Docker Compose
to actually start the containers.

Typing that entire command out is painful, though. Let's ask mzcompose to
generate a convenience script for us:

```shell
$ bin/mzcompose gen-shortcuts
```

Now we can run `./mzcompose` from within the `test/fancy` directory:

```shell
cd test/fancy
$ ./mzcompose ps
==> Collecting mzbuild dependencies
materialize/billing-demo:FM4STU42G7W44OLAPKZNEZWGEPTMIVE6
materialize/fancy-loadgen:Z2GPU4TQMCV2PGFTNUPYLQO2PQAYD6OY
==> Delegating to Docker Compose
    Name                Command            State    Ports
---------------------------------------------------------
fancy_fancy_1   python3 fancy-loadgen.py   Exit 0
```

Let's add another mzbuild dependency, this time on `materialized`:

```yml
version: "3.7"

services:
  fancy:
    mzbuild: fancy-loadgen
  materialized:
    mzbuild: materialized
```

`mzcompose` will automatically acquire the new dependency on the next
invocation. Note that if you have local changes to any Rust code, you'll likely
want to stash them away now, or `mzcompose` will be spending a lot of time
recompiling a fresh version of the `materialized` image.

```shell
$ ./mzcompose up
==> Collecting mzbuild dependencies
materialize/billing-demo:FM4STU42G7W44OLAPKZNEZWGEPTMIVE6
materialize/fancy-loadgen:Z2GPU4TQMCV2PGFTNUPYLQO2PQAYD6OY

materialized_1  | hint: You may also set the environment variable MZ_WORKERS to the desired number
materialized_1  | of threads.
fancy_fancy_1 exited with code 0
fancy_materialized_1 exited with code 1
```

And that's it. Pretty simple. Note that you can add normal `image` services to
your `mzcompose.yml`, too. That works just as it would in vanilla Docker
Compose.

```yml
version: "3.7"

services:
  fancy:
    mzbuild: fancy-loadgen
  materialized:
    mzbuild: materialized
  zookeeper:
    image: zookeeper:3.4.13
```

A common complaint with Docker Compose is the lack of proper service
orchestration. It is not possible to express, for exaple, that the `fancy`
service cannot be started until `materialized` has booted successfully.

`mzcompose` therefore provides a feature called "workflows" that orchestrate
interacting with the defined services. The following `load-test` workflow waits
for `materialized` to start listening on port 6875 before launching the `fancy`
service.

```
version: "3.7"

services:
  fancy:
    mzbuild: fancy-loadgen
  materialized:
    mzbuild: materialized

mzworkflows:
  load-test:
    steps:
    - step: start-services
      services: [materialized]
    - step: wait-for-tcp
      host: materialized
      port: 6875
    - step: start-services
      services: [fancy-loadgen]
```

To run the workflow, run `./mzcompose run load-test`, just like you would if
`load-test` were a normal service.

#### Release vs Development Builds

Via `mzbuild`, `mzcompose` supports building binaries in either release or
development mode. By default, binaries are built using release mode. You can
specify the desired flavor by passing the `--mz-build-mode` flag to
`mzcompose`:

```shell
$ bin/mzcompose --mz-build-mode=dev --mz-find fancy up
$ bin/mzcompose --mz-build-mode=release --mz-find fancy up
```

## Input addressability

mzbuild is an *input-addressable* build system.

The key insight is that most Docker images are designed to be a pure function
from a set of input files to a packaged image. Images generally only need to be
built once for a given set of inputs.

In practice, Docker build processes tend to depend on non-reproducible state,
like APT repositories or the current time, but these typically don't have a
meaningful impact on the build, and we are happy to ignore these annoyances for
now.

mzbuild uses SHA-1 hashes for its fingerprints, like Git. To prevent confusing a
fingerprint for a Git commit SHA, mzbuild fingerprints are encoded in uppercase
[Base32]. (Base32 is a bit easier to handle than Base64, as it doesn't include
any non-alphanumeric characters.)

## Development

mzbuild and mzcompose are Python 3 libraries that lives in
[misc/python/materialize/cli](/misc/python/materialize/cli).

Its only dependency is Python 3.5+, which is easy to find or pre-installed on
most Linux distributions, and pre-installed on recent versions of macOS, too.
Python dependencies are automatically installed into a virtualenv by the
[pyactivate wrapper script](/bin/pyactivate).

Using Python 3.6 would be a good bit more convenient, but our CI image runs on
Ubuntu 16.04, which is still shipping Python 3.5. Supporting the oldest Ubuntu
LTS release seems like a decent baseline, anyway.

Integration tests for `mzcompose` are in [`test/mzcompose`](/test/mzcompose).

## Reference

### mzbuild.yml

An `mzbuild.yml` file describes how to build a Docker image from a `Dockerfile`
and a pre-`docker build` plugin.

The directory containing a `mzbuild.yml` file is called the "mzbuild context."

#### Example

```yml
name: materialized
pre-image:
  type: cargo-build
  bin: materialized
  strip: false
publish: true
```

#### Fields

* `name` (string, required) is an identifier for the image. It must be unique
  within the repository. If the image is publishable, it will be published to
  Docker Hub as `materialize/<name>`.

* `pre-image` (map) specifies a plugin to run *before* invoking `docker build`.
  This is where the magic happens for Rust code.

  At the moment `pre-image` only supports three plugins:

  * `type: copy` recursively copies the contents of a directory into the mzbuild
     context.

     The `source` field specifies the directory from which files should be
     copied. It is relative to the root of the repository. The `destination`
     field specifies the directory into which files should be copied. It is
     relative to the mzbuild context. Both fields are required.

     The name of the file in the `destination` directory will be the name of the
     file in the `source` directory with the `source` prefix removed. So a file
     named `/path/to/source/a/b/c.ext` will be copied into
     `/path/to/destination/a/b/c.ext`.

     The optional `matching` field specifies a glob that determines which
     files in the `source` directory to copy.

  *  `type: cargo-bin` builds a Rust binary with Cargo. The `bin` field
     indicates the name of the binary target in the Cargo workspace to build.
     The resulting artifact will be placed into the mzbuild context.

     All files within the crate directory, and all files within the directories
     of any transitive _path_ dependencies of the crate (i.e., dependencies in
     this workspace, rather than on crates.io), will be considered as additional
     inputs to the build, plus the top-level `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and
     `.cargo/config` files.

     Cargo is invoked with the `--release` flag if the `--mz-build-mode` flag
     variable is `release` (the default; set to `dev` for a non-release
     binary). The binary will be stripped of debug information unless `strip:
     false` is requested.

     In rare cases, it may be necessary to extract files from the build
     directory of a dependency. The `extract` key specifies a mapping from a
     dependent package to a list of files to copy into the build context. Paths
     should be relative and are interpreted relative to that crate's build
     directory. Each extracted file will be placed in the root of the build
     context with the same name as the original file. Copying directories is not
     supported. Note that `extract` is only relevant if the dependency has a
     custom Cargo build script, as Rust crates without a build script do not
     have a build directory.

  * `type: cargo-test` builds a special image that simulates `cargo test`. This
     plugin is very special-cased at the moment, and unlikely to be generally
     useful.

* `publish` (bool) specifies whether the image should be automatically published
  to Docker Hub by CI. Non-publishable images can still be *used* by users and
  CI, but they must always be built from source. Use sparingly. The default is
  `true`.

* `build-args` (map[str, str]) a list of parameters to pass as [`--build-arg`][buildarg]
  to Docker. For example:

  ```yaml
  name: example
  build-args:
    VERSION: '1.0'
  ```

[buildarg]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg

#### Build artifacts

When using a `pre-image` plugin, arbitrary build artifacts will be copied into
the mzbuild context. Be sure to add a `.gitignore` to the mzbuild context and
ignore these files! Ignored files will be excluded from the mzbuild fingerprint,
and will be automatically deleted at the beginning of the pre-image phase to
ensure idempotent builds.

### mzcompose.yml

An mzcompose configuration file is a small extension to the [Docker Compose
configuration file][compose-ref]. All extensions apply to the `services`
top-level map.

#### Example

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  materialized:
    mzbuild: materialized
    propagate-uid-gid: true

mzworkflows:
  NAME:
    env:
      KEY: VALUE
    steps:
    - step: STEP-NAME
      STEP-OPTION: STEP-OPTION-VALUE
```

#### Fields

* `mzbuild` (string) indicates that the service's image should be dynamically
  acquired by mzcompose prior to invoking Docker Compose. The value must match
  the name of an image in the repository.

  If `mzbuild` is specified, neither of the standard properties `build` nor
  `image` should be specified.

* `propagate-uid-gid` (bool) requests that the Docker image be run with the user
  ID and group ID of the host user. It is equivalent to passing `--user $(id
  -u):$(id -g)` to `docker run`. The default is `false`.

* `mzworkflows` (dict) specifies a named set of workflows. A workflow consists
  of a series of steps that are executed in sequence and a set of environment
  variables that are set during the execution of the workflow. The available
  steps and their options are only documented by way of the developer docs.
  See <https://mtrlz.dev/api/python/materialize/mzcompose.html>.

  Also see the [chbench demo mzcompose](../../demo/chbench/mzcompose.yml) for
  a detailed example.

#### Bash-like Environment Substitution

`mzcompose` performs "bash-like" variable substitution within workflows (for `services` the block,
docker-compose is responsible for [variable
substitution](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#variable-substitution)).
For example, you can define the following workflow, and it will pull `MZ_WORKERS` from your
environment:

```yaml
mzworkflows:
  example_workflow:
    env:
      # Use MZ_WORKERS from the environment. If not set, default to empty string
      MZ_WORKERS: ${MZ_WORKERS}
    steps:
    - step: STEP-NAME
      STEP-OPTION: STEP-OPTION-VALUE
```

The variable substitution can occur anywhere with the workflow specification:

```yaml
mzworkflows:
  example_workflow:
    env:
      # Use MZ_WORKERS from the environment. If not set, default to empty string
      MZ_WORKERS: ${MZ_WORKERS}
    steps:
    - step: STEP-NAME
      STEP-OPTION: ${MZ_WORKERS}
```

Support for default values similarly as it does in bash, but the full syntax is not supported. At
the moment, `mzcompose` only supports default replacement via the `:-` operator and only for
variables using the `${VARIABLE}` syntax:

```yaml
mzworkflows:
  example_workflow:
    env:
      # If MZ_WORKERS is set, use the value from the environment. Otherwise use 16
      MZ_WORKERS: ${MZ_WORKERS:-16}
    steps:
    - step: STEP-NAME
      STEP-OPTION: STEP-OPTION-VALUE
```

For workflows triggered by another workflow, variables substitution occurs at the time the
workflow is triggered (as opposed to when the composition is loaded). This means that you can set
an environment variable in one workflow and it will be picked up by the second workflow:

```yaml
mzworkflows:
  workflow1:
    env:
      # Explicitly set the value to 16, ignoring the parent environment
      MZ_WORKERS: 16
    steps:
    - step: workflow
      workflow: workflow2
  workflow2:
    env:
      # MZ_WORKERS will be 16 if called from workflow1
      # If not called from workflow1, it pull the value from the environment or default
      MZ_WORKERS: ${MZ_WORKERS:-32}
    steps:
    - step: STEP-NAME
      STEP-OPTION: STEP-OPTION-VALUE
```

The preference order for variable subsitution is:

1. The value specified by the mzworkflow.
2. The value specified by the environment.
3. The default value specified where the variable is being used.
4. Empty string.

### mzbuild Dockerfile

An mzbuild Dockerfile is like a [normal Dockerfile][dockerfile-ref], but it can depend on other
mzbuild images.

#### Example

```dockerfile
MZFROM materialized

FROM ubuntu:bionic-20200403

COPY --from=0 ...
```


#### Commands

* `MZFROM <string> [AS <name>]` sets the base image for the build stage to the
  specified mzbuild image. It is like the vanilla Dockerfile [FROM
  command][dockerfile-from], except that the image named must be a valid mzbuild
  image in the repository, not a vanilla Docker image.

## Motivation

### Why a new build system?

End-to-end tests of Materialize can involve orchestrating a dozen different
services: ZooKeeper, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Prometheus, Grafana, load simulators,
and so on. So far, the most workable solution for managing such a dizzying array
of services has involved Docker and Docker Compose.

Docker has its shortcomings, but its popularity means it is more widely used and
understood than any other tool we're aware of. Many developers have a passing
familiarity with Docker. Empirically, many users of Materialize are willing to
download Dockerâ€”or already have it installedâ€”in order to take Materialize for a
spin, and some prospective customers have explicitly requested the Docker
distribution channel. The situation is similar with Docker Compose: it's not
perfect, but it gives us a lot of power for free.

If you are not sold on Docker, see the [Why docker?](#why-docker) section below.

Our single biggest pain point with Compose has been the inability to seamlessly
share Compose configurations between our developers, CI, and downstream users
running demos. Developers want the Compose files to build all images from
source, so that changes made locally are reflected in the containers. Users want
Compose files to download images from Docker Hub, since building the images from
source can take the better part of an hour, if they even have a build toolchain
available. And CI wants both, as it needs to build from source on one machine,
then distribute those pre-built images to downstream workers.

Compose, however, requires you to commit to an option for every service. Either
a) a service is built from source or, b) it is downloaded from Docker Hub, and
there is no in between.

To make matters worse, even if Compose had the desired behavior, building Rust
inside of a Dockerfile-managed build process would take upwards of 10m. Since
Docker builds start from a clean sandbox on every run, the Cargo cache is
freezing cold, and all dependencies must be compiled from scratch. Instead, we
need to build the Rust code outside of the Docker build process on a host
machine with a warm Cargo cache, and then copy the built binary into the Docker
build context.

To work around these limitations, our codebase has grown an increasingly complex
collection of shell scripts and Buildkite configurations. Aside from the
maintainability concerns, there is also a serious usability concern: every demo
has a slightly different interface to run it, configure it, test changes to it,
and deploy it.

So since we don't want to give up on Docker and Compose, the best option seemed
to be a thin wrapper script on top of Compose that acquired all the necessary
Docker images, using whatever means necessary, and then delegated to Compose
once all the images were in place. That wrapper script is mzbuild.

### Why Docker?

Our requirements for a demo and testing tool are as follows:

  * Support for macOS and Linux.
    * Ideally, the platform differences would be entirely handled by the tool,
      and invisible to those using it.
  * Automatic downloading and installation of myriad services.
  * Version pinning, so that everyone runs the same version of the services.
  * Automatic configuration of those services to talk to one another.
  * High probability that if a demo or test works on one machine, it will
    work on another.
  * Easy cleanup, so that data generated by the demo or test does not persist
    permanently on the user's machine.

Docker and Docker Compose satisfy all of the above criteria. The (fair)
criticisms are that the tools are complicated, slow, and hard to understand and
debug, but so far it seems the tradeoff seems worth it.

The closest competitors to Docker and Compose are [Kubernetes] and [Helm], but
these are *more* complicated than Docker and Compose, as they're more focused on
the enterprise-grade production deployment scenario.
