# Publishing packages

Several components of Materialize are distributed as packages for

## Docker images

Use [mzbuild](mzbuild.md) to build and push Docker images to the
[materialize](https://hub.docker.com/u/materialize) Docker Hub organization.
When you add a new publishable mzbuild image, you'll need an infrastructure
admin to create the Docker Hub repositoryâ€”ask in #eng-infra if you don't have
the required permissions.

## Rust crates

Before publishing internal Rust crates to `crates.io`(https://crates.io/), be
sure to indicate that `MaterializeInc` is the reponsible maintainer by running
the following command:

```shell
cargo owner --add github:MaterializeInc:crate-owners
```

## PyPI

Use the [`materializeinc`](https://pypi.org/user/materializeinc/) PyPI user to
upload and update Materialize's Python packages on PyPI. Login information can
be found in the shared 1Password account.
