  vX.Y.Z`. (Copy this checklist [from raw markdown][release-checklist-raw], and create [a
  new issue][new-issue].)

## Release candidate

A release candidate is the Materialize codebase at a given commit, tested for
production readiness.

### Create the release candidate

- [ ] Choose the desired commit. Most often, this will be the latest commit to master.

  ```shell
  git checkout <SHA>
  ```

- [ ] Choose the name for the release candidate following the format
  `v<VERSION>-rc<N>`, where _N_ starts at 1. For example, the first RC for
  v0.2.3 would be called v0.2.3-rc1.

- Update the version fields in these files, and commit that change:

  - [ ] [`src/materialized/Cargo.toml`](../../src/materialized/Cargo.toml)
  - [ ] [`LICENSE`](/LICENSE)

- [ ] Create the release tag on the current commit.

  ```shell
  tag=v<VERSION>-rc<N>
  git tag -a $tag -m $tag
  git push origin $tag  # where 'origin' is your MaterializeInc/materialize remote
  ```

- [ ] On **master**:
  - Update the version field in
    [`src/materialized/Cargo.toml`](../../src/materialized/Cargo.toml) to `vNEXT-dev`.
    For example, if releasing v0.1.2, bump the version on master to `v0.1.3-dev`.
  - Run `cargo check` (or any other build command) to ensure that that `Cargo.lock` file
    is correct.


### Test the release candidate

All of these can be run in parallel.

- [ ] Run the chbench load test on the release candidate tag.

  - [ ] Spin up a fresh VM and start the load test.

    Materialize employees can follow [these instructions for running semi-
    automatic load tests][load-instr] in the infrastructure
    repository.

    [load-instr]: https://github.com/MaterializeInc/infra/tree/master/cloud#starting-a-load-test

  - [ ] From the VM, ensure all containers are running:
    ```shell script
    docker ps -a
    ```

  - [ ] Let the test run for 24 hours.

  - [ ] Take a screenshot of the Grafana dashboard with the full 24 hours of
    data and share it in the #release channel in Slack.

  - [ ] Stop Prometheus, and upload a backup of the data to the #release
    channel in Slack.

    ```shell
    ./dc.sh stop prometheus
    ./dc.sh backup
    ```

- [ ] Run the perf-kinesis load test on the tag.

  - [ ] Spin up a fresh VM and start the load test. To start the load test, ssh
    into the VM and run:
    ```shell script
    cd materialize/test/performance/perf-kinesis
    ./mzcompose up -d
    ```

  - [ ] Ensure all containers started successfully and are running:
    ```shell script
    docker ps -a
    ```

  - [ ] Let the test run for 24 hours.

  - [ ] Take a screenshot of the "Time behind external source" dashboard panel
    in Grafana. (This metric should have remained at 0ms or similar for the entirety
    of the run). Share the screenshot in the Slack channel.

- [ ] Run the billing-demo load test on the tag.

  - [ ] Spin up the billing-demo with an updated `--message-count` argument.

    ```shell
    cd demo/billing
    # Manually edit the mzcompose.yml to have `--message-count 100000000`
    # Follow the rest of the instructions in README.md
    ```

  - [ ] The billing-demo container should run and finish without error.


## Final release

### Create git tag

- [ ] Check out the final RC tag.

- [ ] Update the version field in [`src/materialized/Cargo.toml`](../../src/materialized/Cargo.toml)
  and commit that change.

- [ ] Create the release tag on that commit.

  ```shell
  tag=v<VERSION>
  git tag -a $tag -m $tag
  git push origin $tag  # where 'origin' is your MaterializeInc/materialize remote
  ```

### Create Homebrew Bottle and update tap

- [ ] Follow the instructions in [MaterializeInc/homebrew-materialize's
  CONTRIBUTING.md][homebrew-guide].

### Verify the Debian package.

- [ ] Go to [the bintray `materialized` apt repo][bintray] and just check that
  the version you have published is present and published

[bintray]: https://bintray.com/beta/#/materialize/apt/materialized


### Convert the github Tag into a GitHub Release

- [ ] Go to [the materialize releases][releases] page and find the tag that you
  created as part of the "Final Release" step.

  - Click "Edit" on the top right
  - Use the version as the name.
  - Fill out the description by copying the description from an earlier release
    ([v0.1.2., for example][v0.1.2]) and updating the links appropriately.

### Update the master branch for the next version

- [ ] On **master**, update the various files that must be up to date:

  - [ ] Update the [`LICENSE`](/LICENSE) file with the changes from the
    release branch, so that it reflects the latest release of Materialize.
    <details><summary>Example git command</summary>

    ```console
    $ git checkout v0.2.1 -- LICENSE
    ```

    </details>

  - [ ] Ensure that the [Release Notes](../../doc/user/release-notes.md) are up
    to date, including the current version.

## Finish

- [ ] Close the release issue you opened as the first step
