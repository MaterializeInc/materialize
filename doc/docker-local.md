# Running materialized on the Linux host, and the rest of the load test in containers.

## Disclaimer

This is hacky, and not intended to be used for any long-term or production
use case! A much better way of doing things would be to run a simple DNS
server locally that integrates with Docker to map the container names to IP
addresses. There are various explanations of how to do this on Stack Overflow.

If you permanently screw up your /etc/hosts somehow, please don't blame me!

I suspect that this will not work at all on macOS.

## Instructions (assuming Ubuntu)

* First make sure you have jq installed:

```
sudo apt install -y jq
```

* Edit `ex/chbench/docker-compose.yml` to remove all references to the
following containers: `materialize`, `cli`, and all the metrics-related
containers (beginning with `grafana` and continuing to the end of the file).
Make sure you don't delete the `volumes` section at the bottom.

* From the `ex/chbench` directory, start up all the containers (except the ones
you removed):

```
sudo docker-compose down && sudo docker-compose up -d --build
```

* From the top repository directory, start `materialized`:

```
cargo run --release --bin materialized
```

* Add the container hostnames to your hosts file:

```
sudo docker network ls |\
 grep chbench_default |\
 awk '{print $1}' |\
 xargs sudo docker inspect |\
 jq -r '.[].Containers |\
 to_entries[] |\
 [.value.IPv4Address, .value.Name] |\
 @tsv' |\
 sed 's|/16||' |\
 sed -E 's/chbench_(.*)_1/\1/' |\
 sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

* Now run the chbench load generator command as normal (see the load_test
function in dc.sh for the exact command). With one small difference: When
running the `chbench run` command you will need to add the flag
`--mz-url='postgresql://172.17.0.1:6875/?sslmode=disable'` to tell the
container where to find the host's `materialized` instance.

* **VERY IMPORTANT**: Don't forget to remove all the stuff that got added to
`/etc/hosts/` when you are done!!
