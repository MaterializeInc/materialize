# doc/user

This is the root directory of the Materialize user docs, which are rendered by
the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site in </www> locally or at <https://materialize.io/docs>.

Instructions for previewing the documentation locally are contained in </www>.

## Viewing the docs site locally

1.
    ```shell
    cd <path to materialize>/www
    ```

1.
    ```shell
    hugo serve -D
    ```

1. Go to <http://localhost:1313/docs>

If you're making changes to the site, you might want a more cache-busting version:

```shell
hugo server --disableFastRender --ignoreCache
```

## Writing & managing docs

### Railroad diagrams for SQL grammar

Railroad diagrams consist of two parts:

- `bnf` files that describe the grammar you want to convey in a railroad
  diagram.
- `html` files that contain an `svg` generated by
  <https://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui>

#### To generate diagrams

1. Modify/create `bnf` files in `/www/layouts/partials/sql-grammar/bnf`.
1. Ensure your diagram looks like you want using
   <https://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui>.
2. Go to `/www/util/rr-diagram-gen/`
3. Run `make run`.

You can now include the diagram on a page using:

```html
{{&lt; diagram "SOME_DIAGRAM.html" &gt;}}
```

- Replace `&lt;` with `<` and `&gt;` with `>`.
- `SOME_DIAGRAM` will be the name of the `bnf` file, and should be an `html`
  file visible in `/www/layouts/partials/sql-grammar/rr-diagrams`.

**Why is the world like this?**

Because our diagrams rely on Hugo's `partials` features, the diagram files are
maintained in the `/www` dir (the actual Hugo site), but referenced as if they
were local (through the magic of symlinks).

## Function + Operator docs

The **Functions** you see at `www/docs/sql/functions/` are populated from
`www/data/sql_funcs.json`. Unfortunately this means that they're ad hoc and are
not actually generated from the Materialize source code.

As new functions get added, this file must be manually updated. The idea here is
to structure functions by their input type (whereas operators are grouped by
their output type), largely influenced by the way that Postgres structures their
function docs.

If you see the need to add or change the grouping here, don't be shy.

## Syntax highlighting

Most code samples contain two components: the SQL query you want to run and the
expected output.

Due to some design choice in the syntax highlighter used by Hugo, you must
select a language to highlight the code blocks in or none of the expected
formatting gets applied.

For SQL blocks, the natural choice is `sql`. For the response blocks, which
don't need to be/shouldn't be syntax highlighted, you can use _any_
non-recognized string as the language (i.e. anything that isn't popular
programming language). For expressivity, we chose `nofmt`.
