# User docs

This is the root directory of the Materialize user documentation, which is
rendered by [Hugo] locally and published by CI to <https://materialize.com/docs>.

For help contributing to the docs, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Structure

- `archetypes`: Metadata templates for new docs.
- `assets`: Content used dynamically, i.e. JavaScript and SCSS.
- `content`: All of the docs content, though this is mostly content symlinked to
  `/doc/user`.
- `data`: Any JSON or YAML files you would want to use as a datastore.
- `layouts`: All of the HTML templates for the site.
    - `partials`: Many HTML components, as well as our SQL diagrams.
- `resources`: The results of dynamically generating content from `assets`.
- `static`: Static files for the site, such as images and fonts.

## Tasks

### (Temporary) Updating LTS Docs

As we start to break apart the binary, we have to work through a temporary phase where users of `v0.26 LTS` (or lower) shouldn't be exposed to documentation changes related to the new features landing in `main`, to avoid confusion. #11795 updated the docs deployment process to use two different branches:

* `lts-docs`: capturing the state of the docs at `v0.26 LTS`, deploying to `https://materialize.com/docs/`
* `main`: ongoing development branch, deploying to `https://materialize.com/docs/unstable/`

#### Shipping updates to Unstable Docs

PRs to `materialize/main` will trigger new builds of materialize.com/docs/unstable/. Deploy docs updates to unstable if:

1. The change applies to both LTS and Unstable _(e.g. if you're correcting a typo on the Postgres source page)_
2. The change only applies to Unstable

#### Shipping updates to LTS Docs

To update `materialize.com/docs`, you need to merge a PR to the `lts-docs` branch (typically, following a PR to `main`) to backport the changes, in which case the process is:

1. Create a new branch on your fork that references `lts-docs`.
   ```
   git checkout -b my-branch-name lts-docs
   ```
2. Cherry-pick the commit from `main` with the changes you need, or just make the necessary changes as you would normally.
   ```
   git cherry-pick COMMIT-SHA-FROM-MAIN
   ```
4. Push your branch.
   ```
   git push
   ```
5. Open a PR - if this was a cherry-picked commit that has already been reviewed, approved and merged to `main`, you can just merge it once CI turns green. If it has conflicts or it is a unique PR for `lts-docs`, then you'll need a review.


### Updating CSS

No CSS is shared with the marketing website to keep the docs CSS maintainable.
If the marketing website changes, we will need to update the docs CSS to
visually match.

### General stylesheet updates

You can see how commonly rendered elements look by going to
[`localhost:1313/stylesheet`](http://localhost:1313/stylesheet).

You can use this as a scratch area by editing [content/stylesheet.md](content/stylesheet.md).

### Railroad diagrams for SQL grammar

Railroad diagrams consist of two parts:

- `bnf` files that describe the grammar you want to convey in a railroad
  diagram.
- `svg` files that contain an `svg` generated by
  <https://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui>

#### To generate diagrams

1. Modify the grammar in `sql-grammar/sql-grammar.bnf`, adding new nonterminals
   as necessary.
1. Ensure the diagram looks like you want using
   <https://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui>.
2. Run `sql-grammar/generate.sh`.

You can now include the diagram on a page using:

```html
{{< diagram "SOME-NONTERMINAL.svg" >}}
```

- `SOME-NONTERMINAL` must be the name of a nonterminal in the BNF.

### Checking links locally

You can check links locally with [`htmltest`](https://github.com/wjdp/htmltest).

Visit their website for installation instructions, or, if you have installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
on a Mac or on Linux, run:

`brew install htmltest`

To check the links on your branch, run:

`./ci/test/lint-docs.sh`

## Function + operator docs

The **Functions** you see at
[content/sql/functions/](content/sql/functions) are populated from
[data/sql_funcs.yml](data/sql_funcs.yml). Unfortunately this means
that they're ad hoc and are not actually generated from the Materialize source
code.

As new functions get added, this file must be manually updated. The idea here is
to structure functions by their input type (whereas operators are grouped by
their output type), largely influenced by the way that Postgres structures their
function docs.

If you see the need to add or change the grouping here, don't be shy.

## `CREATE SOURCE` docs

Sources in Materialize consist of the following components:

- Connectors to some external source of data (e.g. Kafka)
- Formats of that data (e.g. Avro, text)
- Envelopes, which express how Materialize treats data w/r/t CRUD operations
  (e.g. append-only, supporting updated and deletes)

Because each of these three components have multiple implementations, the
docs for `CREATE SOURCE` are broken down by connector. You can find all of the `CREATE SOURCE` docs at [content/sql/create-source](content/sql/create-source/).

### Remaining to-dos

This is currently a v0 of an attempt to simplify managing the `CREATE SOURCE`
docs. Future wants include:

- Modularizing railroad diagrams (i.e. genericize root diagram, and bring in
  specific implementation diagrams when invoked).
- Dynamic front-end that lets users "choose their own adventure" to get the
  correct content in front of them.
- Dynamic sample generator.

## Syntax highlighting

We use Hugo's built-in support for syntax highlighting through Chroma. In
`config.toml`:

```toml
pygmentsCodeFences = true
```

This will probably need to be changed at some point in the future to allow for
highlighting Materialized extensions to the SQL standard, as well as generally
beautifying the syntax highlighting color scheme––but for right now, what's
there suffices.

You can adjust the highlight colors as necessary in
[assets/sass/_highlight.scss](assets/sass/_highlight.scss).

Most code samples contain two components: the SQL query you want to run and the
expected output.

Due to some design choice in the syntax highlighter used by Hugo, you must
select a language to highlight the code blocks in or none of the expected
formatting gets applied.

For SQL blocks, the natural choice is `sql`. For the response blocks, which
don't need to be/shouldn't be syntax highlighted, you can use _any_
non-recognized string as the language (i.e. anything that isn't popular
programming language). For expressivity, we chose `nofmt`.

## Known limitations

- Cannot display formatted text in descriptions or menus (e.g. cannot format
  page titles in code blocks).
- Does not support more than 2 levels in menus.
- Is not "responsive" and makes naive decisions about breakpoints. If someone
  would like to volunteer their web development expertise to make this more
  sane, I would be really happy to help them out.

## Miscellany, trivia, & footguns

- Headers are automatically hyperlinked using [AnchorJS].
- Railroad diagrams are managed in
[layouts/partials/sql-grammar](layouts/partials/sql-grammar).
