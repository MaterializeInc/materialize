## Command line flags

The `materialized` binary supports the following command line flags:

Flag | Default | Modifies
-----|---------|----------
[`--address-file`](#horizontally-scaled-clusters) | N/A|  Address of all coordinating Materialize nodes
[`--data-directory`](#data-directory) | `./mzdata` | Where data is persisted
`--help` | N/A | NOP&mdash;prints binary's list of command line flags
[`--listen-addr`](#listen-address) | `0.0.0.0:6875` | Materialize node's host and port
[`--process`](#horizontally-scaled-clusters) | 0 | This node's ID when coordinating with other Materialize nodes
[`--processes`](#horizontally-scaled-clusters) | 1 | Number of coordinating Materialize nodes
[`--threads`](#worker-threads) | 1 | Dataflow worker threads
[`--w`](#worker-threads) | 1|  Dataflow worker threads

### Data directory

Upon startup `materialized` creates a directory where it persists metadata. By
default, this directory is called `mzdata` and is situated in the current
working directory of the materialized process. Currently, only metadata is
persisted in `mzdata`. You can specify a different directory using the
`--data-directory` flag. Upon start, `materialized` checks for an existing data
directory, and will reinstall source and view definitions from it if one is
found.

### Worker threads

A `materialized` instance runs a specified number of timely dataflow worker
threads. By default, `materialized` runs with a single worker thread. Worker
threads can only be specified at startup by setting the `--threads` flag, and
cannot be changed without shutting down `materialized` and restarting. In the
future, dynamically changing the number of worker threads will be possible over
distributed clusters, see
[#2449](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/2449).

#### How many worker threads should you run?

Adding worker threads allows Materialize to handle more throughput. Reducing
worker threads consumes fewer resources, and reduces tail latencies.

In general, you should use the fewest number of worker threads that can handle
your peak throughputs. This is also the most resource efficient.

You should never run Materialize in a configuration greater than `n-1` workers,
where `n` is the number of _physical_ cores. Note that major cloud providers
list the number of hyperthreaded cores (or _virtual_ CPUs). Divide this number
by two to get the number of physical cores available. The reasoning is simple:
Timely Dataflow is very computationally efficient and typically uses all
available computational resources. Under high throuput, you should see each
worker pinning a core at 100% CPU, with no headroom for hyperthreading. One
additional core is required for metadata management and coordination. Timely
workers that have to fight for physical resources will only block each other.

Example: an `r5d.4xlarge` instance has 16 VCPUs, or 8 physical cores. The
recommended worker setting on this VM is `7`.

### Horizontally scaled clusters

{{< warning >}}

Note that multi-node Materialize clusters are **not** supported by Materialize,
and are not permitted in production under the free usage BSL license without a
separate commercial agreement with Materialize.

{{< /warning >}}

`--processes` controls the total number of nodes in a horizontally-scaled
Materialize cluster. The IP addresses of each node should be specified in a
file, one per line, which is specified by the `--address-file` flag.

When each node is started, it must additionally be told which `--process` it is,
from `0` to `processes - 1`.

You should not attempt running a horizontally-scaled Materialize cluster until
you have maxed-out vertical-scaling. Multi-node clusters are not particulary
efficient. An `x1.32xlarge` instance on AWS has 128 VCPUs, and will be superior
in every way (reliability, cost, ease-of-use) to a multi-node Materialize
cluster with the same total number of VCPUs. It is our performance goal that
Materialize under that configuration be able to handle every conceivable
streaming workload that you may wish to throw at it.

### Listen address

By default, `materialized` binds to `0.0.0.0:6875`. This means that Materialize
will accept any incoming SQL connection to port 6875 from anywhere. It is the
responsibility of the network firewall to limit incoming connections. If you
wish to configure `materialized` to only listen to, e.g. localhost connections,
you can set `--listen-addr` to `localhost:6875`. You can also use this to change
the port that Materialize listens on from the default `6875`.
