## What is Materialize Cloud?

Materialize is a streaming database for real-time applications. Materialize
accepts input data from a variety of streaming sources (like Kafka), data stores and databases (like S3 and Postgres), and files
(like CSV and JSON), and lets you query them using SQL.

Materialize Cloud hosts and maintains Materialize deployments for you. You can set up your account in less than 30 seconds and then try out Materialize with your own streaming data or with a streaming data source that we maintain.

Materialize Cloud is completely free while in beta. We recommend that you start with development and testing workloads for now and do not rely on the beta version for handling production tasks.
