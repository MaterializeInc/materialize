This functionality is only available to [administrators](administer-workspace).

1. On the [Deployments](https://cloud.materialize.com/deployments) page, click **+New deployment**.

1. Select the desired deployment size and click **Create**.

Materialize creates the deployment, automatically assigning it a name and hostname. The deployment should be ready for connections in about a minute and a half.

The free version of Materialize Cloud allows two deployments. The enterprise version is unlimited.
