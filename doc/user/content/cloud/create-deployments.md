1. On the [Deployments](https://cloud.materialize.com/deployments) page, click **Create deployment**.

    The default deployment size is **Extra small** (XS). In the trial period, you can go up to **Small** (S) deployment sizes. If you know in advance the resources your use case requires, [reach out to us](../support) to discuss the details.

1. Click **Create**.

    The deployment will be ready to accept connections as soon as the status message reads `HEALTHY`.

**Trial period**

The trial period lasts for **30 days** or **until you max out the available resources** (whichever comes first), and is limited to **two** deployments. Once the trial expires, your account and deployments may be deleted within 14 days, unless you have upgraded to an enterprise account.
