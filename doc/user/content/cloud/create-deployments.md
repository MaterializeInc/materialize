On the [Deployments](https://cloud.materialize.com/deployments) page, click **Create deployment**.

Materialize creates the deployment and assigns it a name and hostname. This should only take about a minute and a half.

The free version of Materialize Cloud allows two deployments. If you need more, please [contact us](../support).
