Materialize Cloud hosts and maintains a Materialize instance for you. You can set up your account in less than 30 seconds and then try out Materialize with your own streaming data or with a streaming data source we maintain.

Materialize Cloud is completely free while in pre-release. We recommend you start with development and testing workloads for now and do not rely on the pre-release version for handling production tasks.
