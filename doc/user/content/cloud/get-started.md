Materialize Cloud hosts and maintains Materialize deployments for you. You can set up your account in less than 30 seconds and then try out Materialize with your own streaming data or with a streaming data source that we maintain.

Materialize Cloud is completely free while in pre-release. We recommend you start with development and testing workloads for now and do not rely on the pre-release version for handling production tasks.
