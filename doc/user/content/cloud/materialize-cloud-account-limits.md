For the most part, Materialize Cloud offers the same functionality as the installed version. The major exceptions are:

* Materialize Cloud doesn't support using files as data sources, only streaming sources like Kafka.
* By default, Materialize Cloud only permits two deployments. If you need more than that, <a href="mailto:support@materialize.com">let us know</a>.
* We reserve the right to terminate your instance. This may happen after prolonged inactivity or if we need to upgrade Materialize Cloud. Catalog items persist across sessions.
* Only one user per instance
