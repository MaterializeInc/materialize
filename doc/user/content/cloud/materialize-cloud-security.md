Currently, Materialize Cloud secures your connections through TLS. In the future, the managed Materialize Cloud product will support IAM identity management for single sign-on, VPC, two-factor authentication, and encryption at rest.

<!-- Are all of these managed, or will some of them be available to the free product? -->
