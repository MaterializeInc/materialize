{{< cloud-notice >}}

Currently, Materialize Cloud secures your connections by enforcing that clients connect via
[TLS 1.2+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security). In the future, the managed
Materialize Cloud product will offer additional security options, such as:

* Two-factor authentication
* Encryption at rest
* Connection over VPC and VPN
* Single sign-on integration (SSO)

If you're interested in implementing any of these security features, please [let us know](../support).

<!-- Are all of these managed, or will some of them be available to the free product? -->
