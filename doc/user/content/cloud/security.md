Currently, Materialize Cloud secures your connections through TLS. In the future, the managed Materialize Cloud product will support IAM identity management for single sign-on, VPC, two-factor authentication, and encryption at rest.

If you're interested in implementing any of these security features, please [let us know](../support).

<!-- Are all of these managed, or will some of them be available to the free product? -->
