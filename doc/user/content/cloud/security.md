{{< cloud-notice >}}

Materialize Cloud secures your connections by enforcing that clients connect via
[TLS 1.2+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), and supports:

* Multi-factor authentication
* Encryption at rest
* Single sign-on integration (SSO)

In the future, the enterprise product will also provide secure network ingress and egress. If you have other specific security requirements, please [let us know](../support).
