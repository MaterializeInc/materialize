In Account Settings, you can update your personal details and change your password, as well as enable [administrative users](../administer-workspace) to change workspace names and add or remove users.

To go to your Materialize Cloud settings, click on the user icon in the right of the top navbar.

## Profile

On the Profile tab, you change any of the following:

* Email address
* Name
* Phone number
* Address
* Job title

If you wish to delete your profile or Materialize account, [reach out to us](../support). If you are the sole administrator of any workspaces, you will be asked whether you want to delete the workspace as well or give administrator privileges to another user.

## Privacy &amp; security

On the Privacy & Security tab, you can change your password and enable/disable two-factor authentication.
