{{< cloud-notice >}}

When a new version of Materialize Cloud is available, an **Update available** notice appears on the [Deployments](https://cloud.materialize.com/memorys) page. Click the notice and enter the requested confirmation to update the deployment. We recommend updating a non-production deployment first and testing to ensure that your materializations and computations continue to work as expected.

If you haven't upgraded a deployment to the latest version within 14 days, we will apply the new version automatically.
