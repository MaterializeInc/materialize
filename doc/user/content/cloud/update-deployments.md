When a new version of Materialize Cloud is available, an **Update available** notice appears on the [Deployments](https://cloud.materialize.com/deployments) page. Click the notice and enter the requested confirmation to update the deployment.  We recommend updating a single deployment first and testing to ensure that your materializations and computations continue to work as expected.

If you haven't updated a deployment to the latest version in two weeks, we will apply the new version automatically.
