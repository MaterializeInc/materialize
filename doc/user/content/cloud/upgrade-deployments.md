Upgrading Materialize Cloud requires a brief downtime. For this reason, we don't automatically upgrade the Cloud version of your deployments. An **Upgrade** button appears on the [Deployments](https://cloud.materialize.com/deployments) page when a new version is available. You can apply the upgrade at the time that works best for you.

If the upgrade is unsuccessful, you will see a **Downgrade** button. Click this to restore the previous Materialize version.
