Materialize Cloud hosts and maintains [Materialize deployments](/overview/what-is-materialize) for you. You can set up your account in less than 30 seconds and then try out Materialize with your own streaming data or with a streaming data source that we maintain.

Materialize Cloud is completely free while in pre-release. We recommend that you start with development and testing workloads for now and do not rely on the pre-release version for handling production tasks.
