The pages in this section introduces some of the key concepts in Materialize:

Component                                | Use
-----------------------------------------|-----
[Clusters](/concepts/clusters/)          | Clusters are isolated pools of compute resources for sources, sinks, indexes, materialized views, and ad-hoc queries.
[Sources](/concepts/sources/)            | Sources describe an external system you want Materialize to read data from.
[Views(Non-Materialized and Materialized)](/concepts/views/)    | Views represent queries of sources and other views that you want to save for repeated execution.
[Indexes](/concepts/indexes/)            | Indexes represent query results stored in memory.
[Sinks](/concepts/sinks/)                | Sinks describe an external system you want Materialize to write data to.

Refer to the individual pages for more information.
