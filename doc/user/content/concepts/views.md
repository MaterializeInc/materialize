## Overview

Views represent queries that are saved under a name for reference. Views provide
a shorthand for the underlying query.

Materialize offers the following types of views:

Type |
-----|------------
[**Non-materialized views**](#non-materialized-views) | Results are **not** persisted in durable storage. Non-materialized views can be indexed to maintain and incrementally update results in memory.
[**Materialized views**](#materialized-views) | Results **are** persisted and incrementally updated in durable storage. Materialized views can be indexed to maintain the results in memory.

All views in Materialize are built by reading data from
[sources](/concepts/sources) and other views.

## Non-materialized views

A non-materialized view, also generally referred to as a "view", saves a query
under a name to provide a shorthand for referencing the query. The query is
**not** executed during non-materialized view creation, and a non-materialized
view does **not** persist its results in durable storage.

**However**, you can [index](/concepts/indexes/) a non-materialized view to
**maintain and incrementally update view results** in memory within a cluster.
This enables queries within that [cluster](/concepts/clusters/) to use the index
to access view results from memory.  See [Indexes and non-materialized
views](#indexes-and-non-materialized-views) for more information.

### Indexes and non-materialized views

Indexes can improve query performance. In Materialize, non-materialized views
can be [indexed](/concepts/indexes/). Indexing a non-materialized view causes
view results to be **maintained and incrementally updated in memory** within
that [cluster](/concepts/clusters/). The in-memory up-to-date results are
accessible to queries within the cluster, even for queries that do not use the
index key(s).

Indexes are local to a cluster.

- [Indexes](/concepts/indexes/)
- [`CREATE INDEX`](/sql/create-index/)

### Clusters and non-materialized views

A non-materialized view can be referenced in any [cluster](/concepts/clusters/).
However, if the non-materialized view is indexed, in-memory results are only
accessible to queries within the cluster.

Indexes are local to a cluster.  Queries in a different cluster cannot use the
indexes in another cluster.

## Materialized views

A materialized view, like a non-materialized view, saves a query under a name to
provide a shorthand for referencing the query. But, unlike a non-materialized
view, the query is executed during the view creation, and a materialized view
**persists and incrementally updates** its results in durable storage.

You can index a materialized view to maintain the results in memory
within the cluster. This enables queries within the cluster to use the index to
access view results from memory.  See [Indexes and materialized views](#indexes-and-materialized-views)
for more information.

### Indexes and materialized views

Indexes can improve query performance. In Materialize,
[indexing](/concepts/indexes/) a materialized view maintains the results in
memory within the [cluster](/concepts/clusters/).  Because materialized views
maintain the up-to-date results in durable storage, indexes on materialized
views serve up-to-date results without themselves performing the incremental
computation. The in-memory up-to-date results are accessible to queries within
the cluster, even for queries that do not use the index key(s).

Indexes are local to a cluster.

- [`CREATE INDEX`](/sql/create-index/)

### Clusters and materialized views

A materialized view can be referenced in any [cluster](/concepts/clusters/).
Because the up-to-date results of a materialized view are persisted in durable
storage, you can decouple the computational resources used for view maintenance
from the resources used for query serving.

Indexes are local to a cluster.  Queries in a different cluster cannot use the
indexes in another cluster.
