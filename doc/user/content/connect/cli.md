You can connect to a running `materialized` process from your favorite shell
using a compatible command-line client.

### Connection details

Detail | Info
-------|------
**Database** | `materialize`
**User** | Any valid [role](/sql/create-role) (usually `materialize`)
**Port** | `6875`
**SSL** | Not supported yet

Materialize instances have a user named `materialize` installed, unless you drop
this user with [`DROP USER`](/sql/drop-user). You can add additional users with
[`CREATE ROLE`](/sql/create-role).

{{< version-changed v0.7.0 >}}
Materialize requires that you name a valid user when you connect. Previously,
Materialize did not support the concept of roles, so it accepted all user names.
{{< /version-changed >}}

### Supported tools

Tool | Description | Install
-----|-------------|--------
`mzcli` | Materialize-specific CLI | [GitHub](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/mzcli#quick-start)
`psql` | Vanilla PostgreSQL CLI tool | `postgresql` or `postgresql-client`

{{< warning >}}
Not all features of `psql` are supported by Materialize.
{{< /warning >}}

Other tools built for PostgreSQL can often be made to work with Materialize with
minor modifications, but are unlikely to work out of the box.
[File a GitHub issue](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/new?labels=C-feature&template=feature.md)
if there is a PostgreSQL tool you would like us to consider supporting.

## Examples
