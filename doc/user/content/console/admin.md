The [Materialize Console](https://console.materialize.com/) provides an
**Admin** section where you can manage client credentials and, for
administrators, review your usage and billing information.

The **Admin** section contains the following screens:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **App Passwords** | View or delete client credentials that allow your applications and services to connect to Materialize. |
| **Billing** | Access detailed usage and billing information as well as your invoices. <br>**Available for administrators only.** |

created](/console/create-new/#create-new-app-password) to allow your
applications and services to connect to Materialize.

- The [**Connect**](/console/connect/) button provides details needed to connect
to Materialize.

- The **trash can** button deletes the password.
