From the Console, you can create new [clusters](/concepts/clusters/ "Isolated
pools of compute resources (CPU, memory, and scratch disk space)"),
[sources](/concepts/sources/ "Upstream (i.e., external) systems you want
Materialize to read data from"), and application passwords.

### Create new source

{{< tip >}}

- For PostgreSQL and MySQL, you must configure your upstream database first.
  Refer to the [Ingest data](/ingest-data/) section for your data source.

- For information about the snapshotting process that occurs when a new source
  is created as well as some best practice guidelines, see [Ingest
  data](/ingest-data/).

- Only **Organization admins** can create a service account.
- **Personal** apps are run under your user account.
- **Service** apps are run under a Service account user. If the specified
   Service account user does not exist, it will be automatically created the
   **first time** the app password is used.

   {{</ note >}}


   {{< tabs >}}
   {{< tab "Personal" >}}

   For a personal app that you will run under your user account, specify the
   type and required field(s):

   | Type | Details |
   | ---- | ----------- |
   | **Type** | Select **Personal** |
   | **Name** | Specify a descriptive name. |

   {{</ tab >}}
   {{< tab "Service account" >}}

   For an app that you will run under a Service account, specify the
   type and required field(s):

   {{< yaml-table data="console/service_account_fields" >}}

   See also [Create service
   accounts](/security/users-service-accounts/create-service-accounts/) for creating
   service accounts via Terraform.

   {{</ note >}}

1. **For a new service account only**.

   For a new service account, after creating the new app password, you must
   connect with the service account to complete the account creation. {{<
   include-md file="shared-content/rbac/service-account-creation.md" >}}

   To connect:

   1. Find your new service account in the **App Passwords** table.

   1. Click on the **Connect** button to get details on connecting with the new
      account.

      {{< tabs >}}
      {{< tab "psql" >}}
If you have `psql` installed:

1. Click on the **Terminal** tab.
1. From a terminal, connect using the psql command displayed.
1. When prompted for the password, enter the app's password.

Once connected, the service account creation is complete and you can grant roles
to the new service account.

      {{</ tab >}}
      {{< tab "Other clients" >}}
To use a non-psql client to connect,

1. Click on the **External tools** tab to get the connection details.

1. Update the client to use these details and connect.

Once connected, the service account creation is complete and you can grant roles
to the new service account.

To view the created app accounts, go to [Admin > App
Passwords](/console/admin/).
