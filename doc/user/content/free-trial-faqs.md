When you [sign up for Materialize](https://materialize.com/register/), you get a
free trial account so you can explore the product and start building! This page
answers some frequently asked questions about free trials.

For help getting started with your data or other questions about Materialize, you can schedule a [free guided trial](https://materialize.com/demo/?utm_campaign=General&utm_source=documentation).

## What are the limits of a free trial?

In Materialize, [clusters](/concepts/clusters/) are the pools of
compute resources for running your workloads. The size and replication factor
of each cluster determines its [credit usage](/sql/create-cluster/#credit-usage).

During your free trial, the credit consumption rate across all clusters in a
region cannot exceed 4 credits per hour at any point in time. This limit should
accommodate most trial scenarios.

For example, let's say you have 3 clusters in a region:

Cluster     | Size      | Replication factor | Credits per hour
------------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------
`ingest`    | `50cc`    | 1                  | 0.5
`compute`   | `50cc`    | 2                  | 1 (0.5 each)
`quickstart`| `25cc`    | 1                  | 0.25

In this case, your credit consumption rate would be 1.75 credits per hour, which
is under the rate limit of 4 credits per hour.

## How long does a free trial last?

7 days.

If you need additional time, please [chat with our team](http://materialize.com/convert-account/?utm_campaign=General&utm_source=documentation).
Otherwise, Materialize will delete your resources and data at the end of the
trial period.

## How do I monitor my credit consumption rate?

To see your current credit consumption rate, measured in credits per hour, run
the following query against Materialize:

```mzsql
SELECT sum(s.credits_per_hour) AS credit_consumption_rate
  FROM mz_cluster_replicas r
  JOIN mz_cluster_replica_sizes s ON r.size = s.size;
```

For example, if you start your free trial by following the [getting started guide](/get-started/quickstart),
or if you otherwise only use the pre-installed `quickstart` cluster
(`25cc`), you will end up consuming `.25` credit per hour:

```nofmt
 credit_consumption_rate
-------------------------
                     .25
(1 row)
```

## Can I go over the credit rate limit?

No, you cannot go over the rate limit of 4 credits per hour at any time during
your free trial. If you try to add a replica that puts you over the limit,
Materialize will return an error similar to:

```nofmt
Error: creating cluster replica would violate max_credit_consumption_rate limit (desired: 6, limit: 4, current: 3)
Hint: Drop an existing cluster replica or contact support to request a limit increase.
```

If you need additional resources during your trial, [chat with our team](http://materialize.com/convert-account/?utm_campaign=General&utm_source=documentation).
