{{</ note >}}

1. In a terminal, issue the following command to run a Docker container from the
   Materialize Emulator image. The command downloads the image, if one has not
   been already downloaded.

   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:6874:6874 -p 127.0.0.1:6875:6875 -p 127.0.0.1:6876:6876 materialize/materialized:{{< version >}}
   ```

   When running locally:

   - The Docker container binds exclusively to localhost for security reasons.
   - The [Materialize Console](/console/) is available on port `6874`.
   - The SQL interface is available on port `6875`.
   - Logs are available via `docker logs <container-id>`.
   - A default user `materialize` is created.
   - A default database `materialize` is created.

1. <a name="materialize-emulator-connect-client"></a>

   Open the Materialize Console in your browser at [http://localhost:6874](http://localhost:6874).

   Alternatively, you can connect to the Materialize Emulator using your
   preferred SQL client, using the following connection field values:

   | Field    | Value         |
   |----------|---------------|
   | Server   | `localhost`   |
   | Database | `materialize` |
   | Port     | `6875`        |
   | Username | `materialize` |

   For example, if using [`psql`](/integrations/sql-clients/#psql):

   ```sh
   psql postgres://materialize@localhost:6875/materialize
   ```

1. Once connected, you can get started with the
   [Quickstart](/get-started/quickstart).

#### `mz-debug`

Materialize provides a [`mz-debug`]command-line debug tool called  that helps collect diagnostic information from your emulator environment. This tool can gather:
- Docker logs and resource information
- Snapshots of system catalog tables from your Materialize instance

To debug your emulator instance, you can use the following command:

```console
mz-debug emulator --docker-container-id <your-container-id>
```

This debug information can be particularly helpful when troubleshooting issues or when working with the Materialize support team.

For more detailed information about the debug tool, see the [`mz-debug` documentation](/integrations/mz-debug/).
