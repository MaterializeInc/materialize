{{< beta v0.9.0 />}}

By default, Materialize creates new, distinct topics for sinks after each restart. To enable the reuse of the existing topic instead and provide exactly-once processing guarantees, Materialize must be able to do two
things:

* Reconstruct the history of the sinked object and all the objects on which it depends, based on the replayable timestamps of their source events.
* Ensure that no other processes write to the output topic.

This allows for exactly-once stream processing, meaning that each incoming event affects the final results only once, even if the stream is disrupted or Materialize is restarted.

Exactly-once stream processing is currently available only for Kafka sources and the views based on them.

When you create a sink, you must:

- Enable the `reuse_topic` option.
- Optionally specify the name of a [consistency topic](/sql/create-sink/#consistency-metadata) to store the information that Materialize will use to identify the last completed write. The names of the sink topic and the sink consistency topic must be unique across all sinks in the system. The name of the consistency topic may be provided via:
    * The `CONSISTENCY TOPIC` parameter.
    * The `consistency_topic` WITH option. **Note:** This option is only available to support backwards-compatibility. You will not be able to indicate `consistency_topic` and `CONSISTENCY TOPIC` or `CONSISTENCY FORMAT` simultaneously.

    If not specified, a default consistency topic name will be created by appending `-consistency` to the output topic name.
- If you are using a JSON-formatted sink, you must specify that the consistency topic format is AVRO. This is done through the `CONSISTENCY FORMAT` parameter. We're working on JSON support for the consistency topic, but it's not available yet.

Additionally, the sink consistency topic cannot be written to by any other process, including another Materialize instance or another sink.

Because this feature is still in beta, we strongly suggest that you start with test data, rather than with production. Please [escalate](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/new/choose) any issues to us.

## Example

  ```sql
  CREATE SINK quotes_sink
  FROM quotes
  INTO KAFKA BROKER 'localhost:9092' TOPIC 'quotes-eo-sink'
  WITH (reuse_topic=true, consistency_topic='quotes-eo-sink-consistency')
  FORMAT AVRO USING
    CONFLUENT SCHEMA REGISTRY 'http://localhost:8081';
```
