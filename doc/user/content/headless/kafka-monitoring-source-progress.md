### Monitoring source progress

By default, Kafka sources expose progress metadata as a subsource that you can
use to monitor source **ingestion progress**. The name of the progress
subsource can be specified when creating a source using the `EXPOSE PROGRESS
AS` clause; otherwise, it will be named `<src_name>_progress`.

The following metadata is available for each source as a progress subsource:

Field          | Type                                     | Meaning
---------------|------------------------------------------|--------
`partition`    | `numrange`                               | The upstream Kafka partition.
`offset`       | [`uint8`](/sql/types/uint/#uint8-info)   | The greatest offset consumed from each upstream Kafka partition.

And can be queried using:

```mzsql
SELECT
  partition, "offset"
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      -- Take the upper of the range, which is null for non-partition rows
      -- Cast partition to u64, which is more ergonomic
      upper(partition)::uint8 AS partition, "offset"
    FROM
      <src_name>_progress
  )
WHERE
  -- Remove all non-partition rows
  partition IS NOT NULL;
```

As long as any offset continues increasing, Materialize is consuming data from
the upstream Kafka broker. For more details on monitoring source ingestion
progress and debugging related issues, see [Troubleshooting](/ops/troubleshooting/).
