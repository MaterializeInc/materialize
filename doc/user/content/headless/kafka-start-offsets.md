### Setting start offsets

To start consuming a Kafka stream from a specific offset, you can use the `START
OFFSET` option.

```mzsql
CREATE SOURCE kafka_offset
  FROM KAFKA CONNECTION kafka_connection (
    TOPIC 'data',
    -- Start reading from the earliest offset in the first partition,
    -- the second partition at 10, and the third partition at 100.
    START OFFSET (0, 10, 100)
  );
```

Note that:

- If fewer offsets than partitions are provided, the remaining partitions will
  start at offset 0. This is true if you provide `START OFFSET (1)` or `START
  OFFSET (1, ...)`.

- Providing more offsets than partitions is not supported.

#### Time-based offsets

It's also possible to set a start offset based on Kafka timestamps, using the
`START TIMESTAMP` option. This approach sets the start offset for each
available partition based on the Kafka timestamp and the source behaves as if
`START OFFSET` was provided directly.

It's important to note that `START TIMESTAMP` is a property of the source: it
will be calculated _once_ at the time the `CREATE SOURCE` statement is issued.
This means that the computed start offsets will be the **same** for all views
depending on the source and **stable** across restarts.

If you need to limit the amount of data maintained as state after source
creation, consider using [temporal filters](/sql/patterns/temporal-filters/)
instead.
