When using the [serializable](/reference/isolation-level#serializable)
isolation level, the logical timestamp may be arbitrarily ahead of or behind the
system clock. For example, at a wall clock time of 9pm, Materialize may choose
to execute a serializable query as of logical time 8:30pm, perhaps because data
for 8:30–9pm has not yet arrived. In this scenario, `now()` would return 9pm,
while `mz_now()` would return 8:30pm.
