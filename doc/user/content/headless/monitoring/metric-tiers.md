Every metric the stack collects carries an *importance* tier, and each
destination keeps only the metrics at or above a floor you choose. The tiers
below run from most to least important, and the floor is cumulative: it keeps
that tier and every tier above it.

| Tier | What it covers |
|------|----------------|
| `essential` | The metrics that are critical and that you would always want available. These are the ones used in alerting. |
| `recommended` | The metrics used in dashboards, and generally desirable for troubleshooting. |
| `extended` | The metrics used by optional and experimental dashboards. |
| `diagnostic` | The metrics used for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. |
| `all` | Absolutely everything scraped, including metrics no tier classifies. Suited to cheap storage such as the bundled Thanos, not to a metered backend. |

The tiers are shared across the stack, so a tier selected in Terraform means the
same set of metrics as the same tier selected in Helm. For the membership of each
tier, see [List of metrics
⧉](https://materializeinc.github.io/materialize-monitoring/reference/stable-metrics/list-metrics/).
For the metrics Materialize recommends dashboarding and alerting on, see
[essential metrics](/manage/monitor/essential-metrics/), and for everything it
exposes, the [appendix of all metrics](/manage/monitor/appendix-metrics/).

{{< note >}}
The `extended` and `diagnostic` tiers are still being populated, so today they
resolve to the same set as `recommended`. To send everything that is scraped, use
`all`, not `diagnostic`.

{{< warning >}}
The filter fails open. If the allowlist reaches the gateway empty, the gateway
sends everything to that destination rather than nothing. That is safe for
visibility and expensive on a metered backend, so check the receiving backend's
ingest volume after a configuration change.
