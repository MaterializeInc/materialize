The Materialize Terraform modules ([AWS
⧉](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize-terraform-self-managed/tree/main/aws),
[Azure
⧉](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize-terraform-self-managed/tree/main/azure),
[GCP
⧉](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize-terraform-self-managed/tree/main/gcp))
install a monitoring stack alongside your deployment. It is enabled by default
starting with v12.0.0 of the Materialize Terraform Modules. For the module
install steps, see [Install using Terraform
modules](/self-managed-deployments/installation/#install-using-terraform-modules).

The stack collects metrics and logs from Materialize and from the cluster,
stores them in your own infrastructure, and ships dashboards to query them:

- [Metric storage](/manage/monitor/self-managed/metric-store/)

- [Log storage](/manage/monitor/self-managed/log-store/)

- [Grafana](/manage/monitor/self-managed/grafana/), the dashboards and query
  interface that ship with the stack.

To configure the stack outside the Materialize Terraform modules, or to see the
full set of module variables, see the [`materialize-monitoring` Terraform
installation guide
⧉](https://materializeinc.github.io/materialize-monitoring/getting-started/terraform/).
