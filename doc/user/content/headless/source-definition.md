A source in Materialize represents an external data source. More concretely, it
specifies the connection and the ingestion configuration to use for a particular
external data source (e.g., PostgreSQL, Kafka). For those familiar with
PostgreSQL's foreign servers and foreign tables, a source is like a foreign
server, and the tables (or subsources) created from the source are like foreign
tables.

Before creating a source in Materialize, you must ensure that the external data
source is properly configured and accessible so that Materialize can establish a
connection and ingest its data. The exact configuration depends on the type of
data source.
