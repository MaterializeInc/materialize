Change Data Capture (CDC) allows you to track and propagate changes in a Postgres database to downstream consumers based on its Write-Ahead Log (WAL).

This guide shows you how to use [Debezium](https://debezium.io/) and [Kafka](/sql/create-source/kafka/#using-debezium) to propagate CDC data from Postgres to Materialize. Debezium captures row-level changes resulting from `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations in the upstream database and publishes them as events to Kafka using Kafka Connect-compatible connectors.

### Database setup

**Minimum requirements:** PostgreSQL 10+

Before deploying a Debezium connector, you need to ensure that the upstream database is configured to support [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html).

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab "Self-hosted">}}

As a _superuser_:

1. Check the [`wal_level` configuration](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-configuration.html) setting:

    ```sql
    SHOW wal_level;
    ```

    The default value is `replica`. For CDC, you'll need to set it to `logical` in the database configuration file (`postgresql.conf`). Keep in mind that changing the `wal_level` requires a restart of the Postgres instance and can affect database performance.

1. Restart the database so all changes can take effect.

{{< tab "AWS RDS">}}

We recommend following the [AWS RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.LogicalReplication) documentation for detailed information on logical replication configuration and best practices.

As a _superuser_ (`rds_superuser`):

1. Create a custom RDS parameter group and associate it with your instance. You will not be able to set custom parameters on the default RDS parameter groups.

1. In the custom RDS parameter group, set the `rds.logical_replication` static parameter to `1`.

1. Add the egress IP addresses associated with your Materialize region to the security group of the RDS instance. You can find these addresses by querying the `mz_egress_ips` table in Materialize.

1. Restart the database so all changes can take effect.

{{< tab "AWS Aurora">}}

{{< note >}}
Aurora Serverless (v1) [does **not** support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.html#aurora-serverless.limitations) logical replication, so it's not possible to use this service with Materialize.
{{</ note >}}

We recommend following the [AWS Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Logical.html#AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Logical.Configure) documentation for detailed information on logical replication configuration and best practices.

As a _superuser_:

1. Create a DB cluster parameter group for your instance using the following settings:

    Set **Parameter group family** to your version of Aurora PostgreSQL.

    Set **Type** to **DB Cluster Parameter Group**.

1. In the DB cluster parameter group, set the `rds.logical_replication` static parameter to `1`.

1. In the DB cluster parameter group, set reasonable values for `max_replication_slots`, `max_wal_senders`, `max_logical_replication_workers`, and `max_worker_processes parameters`  based on your expected usage.

1. Add the egress IP addresses associated with your Materialize region to the security group of the DB instance. You can find these addresses by querying the `mz_egress_ips` table in Materialize.

1. Restart the database so all changes can take effect.

{{< tab "Azure DB">}}

We recommend following the [Azure DB for PostgreSQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-logical#pre-requisites-for-logical-replication-and-logical-decoding) documentation for detailed information on logical replication configuration and best practices.

1. In the Azure portal, or using the Azure CLI, [enable logical replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/concepts-logical#set-up-your-server) for the PostgreSQL instance.

1. Add the egress IP addresses associated with your Materialize region to the list of allowed IP addresses under the "Connections security" menu. You can find these addresses by querying the `mz_egress_ips` table in Materialize.

1. Restart the database so all changes can take effect.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Cloud SQL">}}

We recommend following the [Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/replication/configure-logical-replication#configuring-your-postgresql-instance) documentation for detailed information on logical replication configuration and best practices.

As a _superuser_ (`cloudsqlsuperuser`):

1. In the Google Cloud Console, enable logical replication by setting the `cloudsql.logical_decoding` configuration parameter to `on`.

1. Add the egress IP addresses associated with your Materialize region to the list of allowed IP addresses. You can find these addresses by querying the `mz_egress_ips` table in Materialize.

1. Restart the database so all changes can take effect.

Once logical replication is enabled:

1. Grant enough privileges to ensure Debezium can operate in the database. The specific privileges will depend on how much control you want to give to the replication user, so we recommend following the [Debezium documentation](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-replication-user-privileges).

1. If a table that you want to replicate has a **primary key** defined, you can use your default replica identity value. If a table you want to replicate has **no primary key** defined, you must set the replica identity value to `FULL`:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE repl_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
    ```

    This setting determines the amount of information that is written to the WAL in `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations. Setting it to `FULL` will include the previous values of all the tableâ€™s columns in the change events.

    As a heads up, you should expect a performance hit in the database from increased CPU usage. For more information, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html).

### Deploy Debezium

**Minimum requirements:** Debezium 1.5+

Debezium is deployed as a set of Kafka Connect-compatible connectors, so you first need to define a Postgres connector configuration and then start the connector by adding it to Kafka Connect.

{{< warning >}}
If you deploy the PostgreSQL Debezium connector in [Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-mysql-source-cdc-debezium.html), you **must** override the default value of `After-state only` to `false`.
{{</ warning >}}

1. Create a connector configuration file and save it as `register-postgres.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "your-connector",
        "config": {
            "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
            "tasks.max": "1",
            "plugin.name":"pgoutput",
            "database.hostname": "postgres",
            "database.port": "5432",
            "database.user": "postgres",
            "database.password": "postgres",
            "database.dbname" : "postgres",
            "database.server.name": "pg_repl",
            "table.include.list": "public.table1",
            "publication.autocreate.mode":"filtered",
            "key.converter": "io.confluent.connect.avro.AvroConverter",
            "value.converter": "io.confluent.connect.avro.AvroConverter",
            "value.converter.schemas.enable": false
        }
    }
    ```

    You can read more about each configuration property in the [Debezium documentation](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.6/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-connector-properties). By default, the connector writes events for each table to a Kafka topic named `serverName.schemaName.tableName`.


1. Start the Debezium Postgres connector using the configuration file:

    ```bash
    export CURRENT_HOST='<your-host>'

    curl -i -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H  "Content-Type:application/json" \
    http://$CURRENT_HOST:8083/connectors/ -d @register-postgres.json
    ```

1. Check that the connector is running:

    ```bash
    curl http://$CURRENT_HOST:8083/connectors/your-connector/status
    ```

    The first time it connects to a Postgres server, Debezium takes a [consistent snapshot](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.6/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-snapshots) of the tables selected for replication, so you should see that the pre-existing records in the replicated table are initially pushed into your Kafka topic:

    ```bash
    /usr/bin/kafka-avro-console-consumer \
      --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 \
      --from-beginning \
      --topic pg_repl.public.table1
    ```

### Create a source

{{< debezium-json >}}

Debezium emits change events using an envelope that contains detailed information about upstream database operations, like the `before` and `after` values for each record. To create a source that interprets the [Debezium envelope](/sql/create-source/kafka/#using-debezium) in Materialize:

```sql
CREATE SOURCE kafka_repl
    FROM KAFKA CONNECTION kafka_connection (TOPIC 'pg_repl.public.table1')
    FORMAT AVRO USING CONFLUENT SCHEMA REGISTRY CONNECTION csr_connection
    ENVELOPE DEBEZIUM
    WITH (SIZE = '3xsmall');
```

This allows you to replicate tables with `REPLICA IDENTITY DEFAULT`, `INDEX`, or `FULL`.

#### Transaction support

Debezium provides [transaction metadata](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/connectors/postgresql.html#postgresql-transaction-metadata) that can be used to preserve transactional boundaries downstream. We are working on using this topic to support transaction-aware processing in Materialize ([#7537](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/7537))!

### Create a materialized view

Any materialized view defined on top of this source will be incrementally updated as new change events stream in through Kafka, as a result of `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations in the original Postgres database.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW cnt_table1 AS
    SELECT field1,
           COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM kafka_repl
    GROUP BY field1;
```
