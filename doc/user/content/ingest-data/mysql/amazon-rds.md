This page shows you how to stream data from [Amazon RDS for MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/)
to Materialize using the [MySQL source](/sql/create-source/mysql).

## Before you begin

{{% mysql-direct/before-you-begin %}}

## A. Configure Amazon RDS

### 1. Enable GTID-based binlog replication

Before creating a source in Materialize, you **must** configure Amazon RDS for
GTID-based binlog replication. For guidance on enabling GTID-based
binlog replication in RDS, see the [Amazon RDS for MySQL documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/mysql-replication-gtid.html).

1. [Enable automated backups in your RDS instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html#USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.Enabling)
by setting the backup retention period to a value greater than `0` to enable
binary logging.

1. [Create a custom RDS parameter group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithDBInstanceParamGroups.html#USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.Creating).

    - Set **Parameter group family** to your MySQL version.
    - Set **Type** to **DB Parameter Group**.

1. Edit the new parameter group to set the configuration parameters to the
   following values:


   | Configuration parameter          | Value | Details |
   |----------------------------------|-------|---------|
   | `log_bin_use_v1_row_events`      | `ON`  | AWS Management Console equivalent to MySQL's `log_bin` configuration parameter. |
   | `binlog_format`                  | `ROW` | This configuration is [deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.34](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format). Newer versions of MySQL default to row-based logging. |
   | `binlog_row_image`               | `FULL`|         |
   | `gtid-mode`                      | `ON`  | AWS Management Console equivalent to MySQL's `gtid_mode` configuration parameter. |
   | `enforce_gtid_consistency`       | `ON`  |         |
   | `replica_preserve_commit_order`  | `ON`  | Only required when connecting Materialize to a read-replica for replication, rather than the primary server. |


1. [Associate the RDS parameter group to your database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithDBInstanceParamGroups.html#USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.Associating).

    Use the **Apply Immediately** option. The database must be rebooted in order
    for the parameter group association to take effect. Keep in mind that
    rebooting the RDS instance can affect database performance.

    Do not move on to the next step until the database **Status**
    is **Available** in the RDS Console.

1. In addition to the step above, you **must** also ensure that
   [binlog retention](/sql/create-source/mysql/#binlog-retention) is set to a
   reasonable value. To check the current value of the [`binlog retention hours`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/mysql-stored-proc-configuring.html#mysql_rds_set_configuration-usage-notes.binlog-retention-hours)
   configuration parameter, connect to your RDS instance and run:

   ```mysql
   CALL mysql.rds_show_configuration;
   ```

   If the value returned is `NULL`, or less than `168` (i.e. 7 days), run:

   ```mysql
   CALL mysql.rds_set_configuration('binlog retention hours', 168);
   ```

   Although 7 days is a reasonable retention period, we recommend using the
   default MySQL retention period (30 days) in order to not compromise
   Materializeâ€™s ability to resume replication in case of failures or
   restarts.

1. To validate that all configuration parameters are set to the expected values
   after the above configuration changes, run:

    ```mysql
    -- Validate "binlog retention hours" configuration parameter
    CALL mysql.rds_show_configuration;
    ```

    ```mysql
    -- Validate parameter group configuration parameters
    SHOW VARIABLES WHERE variable_name IN (
      'log_bin',
      'binlog_format',
      'binlog_row_image',
      'gtid_mode',
      'enforce_gtid_consistency',
      'replica_preserve_commit_order'
    );
    ```

### 2. Create a user for replication

{{% mysql-direct/create-a-user-for-replication %}}

## B. Configure network security

{{% ingest-data/configure-network-security-intro %}}

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab "Allow Materialize IPs">}}

1. In the RDS Console, [add an inbound rule to your RDS security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#adding-security-group-rule)
   to allow traffic from Materialize IPs.

    In each rule:

    - Set **Type** to **MySQL**.
    - Set **Source** to the IP address in CIDR notation.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Use an SSH tunnel">}}

To create an SSH tunnel from Materialize to your database, you launch an
instance to serve as an SSH bastion host, configure the bastion host to allow
traffic only from Materialize, and then configure your database's private
network to allow traffic from the bastion host.

{{< note >}}
Materialize provides a Terraform module that automates the creation and
configuration of resources for an SSH tunnel. For more details, see the
[Terraform module repository](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/terraform-aws-ec2-ssh-bastion).
{{</ note >}}

1. [Launch an EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/LaunchingAndUsingInstances.html)
   to serve as your SSH bastion host.

    - Make sure the instance is publicly accessible and in the same VPC as your
      RDS instance.
    - Add a key pair and note the username. You'll use this username when
      connecting Materialize to your bastion host.

    **Warning:** Auto-assigned public IP addresses can change in [certain cases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses).

    For this reason, it's best to associate an [elastic IP address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#ip-addressing-eips)
    to your bastion host.

1. Configure the SSH bastion host to allow traffic only from Materialize.

1. In the security group of your RDS instance, [add an inbound rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.RDSSecurityGroups.html)
   to allow traffic from the SSH bastion host.

    - Set **Type** to **All TCP**.
    - Set **Source** to **Custom** and select the bastion host's security
      group.

## C. Ingest data in Materialize

### 1. (Optional) Create a cluster

{{< note >}}
If you are prototyping and already have a cluster to host your MySQL
source (e.g. `quickstart`), **you can skip this step**. For production
scenarios, we recommend separating your workloads into multiple clusters for
[resource isolation](/sql/create-cluster/#resource-isolation).
{{< /note >}}

{{% mysql-direct/create-a-cluster %}}

### 2. Start ingesting data

[//]: # "TODO(morsapaes) MySQL connections support multiple SSL modes. We should
adapt to that, rather than just state SSL MODE REQUIRED."

Now that you've configured your database network and created an ingestion
cluster, you can connect Materialize to your MySQL database and start
ingesting data. The exact steps depend on your networking configuration, so
start by selecting the relevant option.

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab "Allow Materialize IPs">}}
{{% mysql-direct/ingesting-data/allow-materialize-ips %}}
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Use an SSH tunnel">}}
{{% mysql-direct/ingesting-data/use-ssh-tunnel %}}
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

[//]: # "TODO(morsapaes) Replace these Step 6. and 7. with guidance using the
new progress metrics in mz_source_statistics + console monitoring, when
available (also for PostgreSQL)."

### 3. Monitor the ingestion status
