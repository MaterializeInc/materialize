Each materialize region is associated with a unique set of static egress
[Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cidr/)
blocks. All connections to the public internet initiated by your Materialize
region will originate from an IP address in the provided blocks.

{{< note >}}
On rare occasion, we may need to change the static egress CIDR blocks associated
with a region. We make every effort to provide advance notice of such changes.
{{< /note >}}

When connecting Materialize to services in your private networks (e.g., Kafka,
PostgreSQL, MySQL), you must configure any firewalls to allow connections from
all CIDR blocks associated with your region. **Connections may originate from
any address in the region**.

Region          | CIDR
----------------|------------
`aws/us-east-1` | 98.80.4.128/27
`aws/us-east-1` | 3.215.237.176/32
`aws/us-west-2` | 44.242.185.160/27
`aws/us-west-2` | 52.37.108.9/32
`aws/eu-west-1` | 108.128.128.96/27
`aws/eu-west-1` | 54.229.252.215/32


## Fetching static egress IPs addresses

You can fetch the static egress CIDR blocks associated with your region by
querying the [`mz_egress_ips`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_catalog/#mz_egress_ips)
system catalog table.

```mzsql
SELECT * FROM mz_egress_ips;
```

```nofmt
  egress_ip    | prefix_length |      cidr
---------------+---------------+-----------------
 3.215.237.176 |            32 | 3.215.237.176/32
 98.80.4.128   |            27 | 98.80.4.128/27
```

As an alternative, you can also submit an HTTP request to Materialize's
[SQL API](/integrations/http-api/) querying the [`mz_egress_ips`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_catalog/#mz_egress_ips)
system catalog table. In the request, specify the username, app password, and
host for your Materialize region:

```
curl -s 'https://<host-address>/api/sql' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --user '<username:app-password>' \
    --data '{ "query": "SELECT cidr from mz_egress_ips;" }' |\
    jq -r '.results[].rows[][]'
```
