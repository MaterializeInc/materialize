This page shows you how to stream data from [Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/)
to Materialize using the [PostgreSQL source](/sql/create-source/postgres/).

## Before you begin

{{% postgres-direct/before-you-begin %}}

## A. Configure Amazon RDS

### 1. Enable logical replication

Materialize uses PostgreSQL's [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html)
protocol to track changes in your database and propagate them to Materialize.

As a first step, you need to make sure logical replication is enabled.

1. As a user with the `rds_superuser` role, use `psql` (or your preferred SQL
   client) to connect to your database.

1. Check if logical replication is enabled:

    ```postgres
    SELECT name, setting
      FROM pg_settings
      WHERE name = 'rds.logical_replication';
    ```
    <p></p>

    ```nofmt
            name             | setting
    -------------------------+---------
    rds.logical_replication  | off
    (1 row)
    ```

    - If logical replication is off, continue to the next step.

    - If logical replication is already on, skip to [Create a publication and a
      Materialize user section](#2-create-a-publication-and-a-replication-user).

1. Using the AWS Management Console, [create a DB parameter group in RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.Creating.html).

    - Set **Parameter group family** to your PostgreSQL version.
    - Set **Type** to **DB Parameter Group**.
    - Set **Engine type** to PostgreSQL.

1. Edit the new parameter group and set the `rds.logical_replication` parameter
   to `1`.

1. [Associate the DB parameter group with your database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.Associating.html).

    Use the **Apply Immediately** option to immediately reboot your database and
    apply the change. Keep in mind that rebooting the RDS instance can affect
    database performance.

    Do not move on to the next step until the database **Status**
    is **Available** in the RDS Console.

1. Back in the SQL client connected to PostgreSQL, verify that replication is
   now enabled:

    ```postgres
    SELECT name, setting
      FROM pg_settings
      WHERE name = 'rds.logical_replication';
    ```
    <p></p>

    ``` nofmt
            name             | setting
    -------------------------+---------
    rds.logical_replication  | on
    (1 row)
    ```

    If replication is still not enabled, [reboot the database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RebootInstance.html).

### 2. Create a publication and a replication user

{{% postgres-direct/create-a-publication-aws %}}

## B. Configure network security

{{% ingest-data/configure-network-security-intro %}}

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab "Allow Materialize IPs">}}

1. In the AWS Management Console, [add an inbound rule to your RDS security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/changing-security-group.html#add-remove-instance-security-groups)
   to allow traffic from Materialize IPs.

    In each rule:

    - Set **Type** to **PostgreSQL**.
    - Set **Source** to the IP address in CIDR notation.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Use an SSH tunnel">}}

To create an SSH tunnel from Materialize to your database, you launch an
instance to serve as an SSH bastion host, configure the bastion host to allow
traffic only from Materialize, and then configure your database's private
network to allow traffic from the bastion host.

{{< note >}}
Materialize provides a Terraform module that automates the creation and
configuration of resources for an SSH tunnel. For more details, see the
[Terraform module repository](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/terraform-aws-ec2-ssh-bastion).
{{</ note >}}

1. [Launch an EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/LaunchingAndUsingInstances.html)
   to serve as your SSH bastion host.

    - Make sure the instance is publicly accessible and in the same VPC as your
      RDS instance.
    - Add a key pair and note the username. You'll use this username when
      connecting Materialize to your bastion host.

    **Warning:** Auto-assigned public IP addresses can change in [certain cases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses).

    For this reason, it's best to associate an [elastic IP address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#ip-addressing-eips)
    to your bastion host.

1. Configure the SSH bastion host to allow traffic only from Materialize.

1. In the security group of your RDS instance, [add an inbound rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-register-targets.html)
   to allow traffic from the SSH bastion host.

    - Set **Type** to **All TCP**.
    - Set **Source** to **Custom** and select the bastion host's security
      group.

## C. Ingest data in Materialize

### 1. (Optional) Create a cluster

{{< note >}}
If you are prototyping and already have a cluster to host your PostgreSQL
source (e.g. `quickstart`), **you can skip this step**. For production
scenarios, we recommend separating your workloads into multiple clusters for
[resource isolation](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-cluster/#resource-isolation).
{{< /note >}}

{{% postgres-direct/create-a-cluster %}}

### 2. Start ingesting data

Now that you've configured your database network and created an ingestion
cluster, you can connect Materialize to your PostgreSQL database and start
ingesting data. The exact steps depend on your networking configuration, so
start by selecting the relevant option.

{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab "Allow Materialize IPs">}}

1. In [Materialize console's SQL Shell](/console/), or
   your preferred SQL client connected to Materialize, use the [`CREATE
   SECRET`](/sql/create-secret/) command to securely store the password for the
   `materialize` PostgreSQL user you created
   [earlier](#2-create-a-publication-and-a-replication-user):

    ```mzsql
    CREATE SECRET pgpass AS '<PASSWORD>';
    ```

1. Use the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/) command to create a
   connection object with access and authentication details for Materialize to
   use:

    ```mzsql
    CREATE CONNECTION pg_connection TO POSTGRES (
      HOST '<host>',
      PORT 5432,
      USER 'materialize',
      PASSWORD SECRET pgpass,
      SSL MODE 'require',
      DATABASE '<database>'
      );
    ```

    - Replace `<host>` with your RDS endpoint. To find your RDS endpoint, select
      your database in the RDS Console, and look under **Connectivity &
      security**.

    - Replace `<database>` with the name of the database containing the tables
      you want to replicate to Materialize.

1. Use the [`CREATE SOURCE`](/sql/create-source/) command to connect Materialize
   to your RDS instance and start ingesting data from the publication you
   created [earlier](#2-create-a-publication-and-a-replication-user):

    ```mzsql
    CREATE SOURCE mz_source
      IN CLUSTER ingest_postgres
      FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION pg_connection (PUBLICATION 'mz_source')
      FOR ALL TABLES;
    ```

    By default, the source will be created in the active cluster; to use a
    different cluster, use the `IN CLUSTER` clause. To ingest data from
    specific schemas or tables in your publication, use `FOR SCHEMAS
    (<schema1>,<schema2>)` or `FOR TABLES (<table1>, <table2>)` instead of `FOR
    ALL TABLES`.

1. After source creation, you can handle upstream [schema changes](/sql/create-source/postgres/#schema-changes)
   for specific replicated tables using the [`ALTER SOURCE...{ADD | DROP} SUBSOURCE`](/sql/alter-source/#context)
   syntax.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Use an SSH tunnel">}}

1. In the [Materialize console's SQL Shell](/console/),
   or your preferred SQL client connected to Materialize, use the [`CREATE
   CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/#ssh-tunnel) command to create an SSH
   tunnel connection:

    ```mzsql
    CREATE CONNECTION ssh_connection TO SSH TUNNEL (
        HOST '<SSH_BASTION_HOST>',
        PORT <SSH_BASTION_PORT>,
        USER '<SSH_BASTION_USER>'
    );
    ```

    - Replace `<SSH_BASTION_HOST>` and `<SSH_BASTION_PORT`> with the public IP
      address and port of the SSH bastion host you created [earlier](#b-configure-network-security).

    - Replace `<SSH_BASTION_USER>` with the username for the key pair you
      created for your SSH bastion host.

1. Get Materialize's public keys for the SSH tunnel connection you just
   created:

    ```mzsql
    SELECT
        mz_connections.name,
        mz_ssh_tunnel_connections.*
    FROM
        mz_connections JOIN
        mz_ssh_tunnel_connections USING(id)
    WHERE
        mz_connections.name = 'ssh_connection';
    ```

1. Log in to your SSH bastion host and add Materialize's public keys to the
   `authorized_keys` file, for example:

    ```sh
    # Command for Linux
    echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAA...76RH materialize" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAA...hLYV materialize" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

1. Back in the SQL client connected to Materialize, validate the SSH tunnel
   connection you created using the [`VALIDATE CONNECTION`](/sql/validate-connection) command:

    ```mzsql
    VALIDATE CONNECTION ssh_connection;
    ```

    If no validation error is returned, move to the next step.

1. Use the [`CREATE SECRET`](/sql/create-secret/) command to securely store the
   password for the `materialize` PostgreSQL user you created
   [earlier](#2-create-a-publication-and-a-replication-user):

    ```mzsql
    CREATE SECRET pgpass AS '<PASSWORD>';
    ```

1. Use the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/) command to create
   another connection object, this time with database access and authentication
   details for Materialize to use:

    ```mzsql
    CREATE CONNECTION pg_connection TO POSTGRES (
      HOST '<host>',
      PORT 5432,
      USER 'materialize',
      PASSWORD SECRET pgpass,
      DATABASE '<database>',
      SSH TUNNEL ssh_connection
      );
    ```

    - Replace `<host>` with your RDS endpoint. To find your RDS endpoint, select
      your database in the RDS Console, and look under **Connectivity &
      security**.

    - Replace `<database>` with the name of the database containing the tables
      you want to replicate to Materialize.

1. Use the [`CREATE SOURCE`](/sql/create-source/) command to connect Materialize
   to your RDS instance and start ingesting data from the publication you
   created [earlier](#2-create-a-publication-and-a-replication-user):

    ```mzsql
    CREATE SOURCE mz_source
      IN CLUSTER ingest_postgres
      FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION pg_connection (PUBLICATION 'mz_source')
      FOR ALL TABLES;
    ```

    By default, the source will be created in the active cluster; to use a
    different cluster, use the `IN CLUSTER` clause. To ingest data from
    specific schemas or tables in your publication, use `FOR SCHEMAS
    (<schema1>,<schema2>)` or `FOR TABLES (<table1>, <table2>)` instead of `FOR
    ALL TABLES`.
