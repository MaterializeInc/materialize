This guide walks through the steps to ingest data from [Segment](https://segment.com/)
into Materialize using the [Webhook source](/sql/create-source/webhook/).

### Before you begin

Ensure that you have:

- A Segment [source](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/) set up and running.

## Step 1. (Optional) Create a cluster

{{< note >}}
If you are prototyping and already have a cluster to host your webhook
source (e.g. `quickstart`), **you can skip this step**. For production
scenarios, we recommend separating your workloads into multiple clusters for
[resource isolation](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-cluster/#resource-isolation).
{{< /note >}}

To create a cluster in Materialize, use the [`CREATE CLUSTER` command](/sql/create-cluster):

```sql
CREATE CLUSTER webhooks_cluster (SIZE = '3xsmall');

SET CLUSTER = webhooks_cluster;
```

## Step 2. Create a secret

To validate requests between Segment and Materialize, you must create a [secret](/sql/create-secret/):

```sql
CREATE SECRET segment_webhook_secret AS '<secret_value>';
```

Change the `<secret_value>` to a unique value that only you know and store it in a secure location.

## Step 3. Set up a webhook source

Using the secret from the previous step, create a [webhook source](/sql/create-source/webhook/)
in Materialize to ingest data from Segment. By default, the source will be
created in the active cluster; to use a different cluster, use the `IN
CLUSTER` clause.

```sql
CREATE SOURCE segment_source IN CLUSTER webhooks_cluster FROM WEBHOOK
  BODY FORMAT JSON
  INCLUDE HEADER 'event-type' AS event_type
  INCLUDE HEADERS
  CHECK (
    WITH ( BODY BYTES, HEADERS, SECRET segment_webhook_secret BYTES)
    constant_time_eq(decode(headers->'x-signature', 'hex'), hmac(body, segment_webhook_secret, 'sha1'))
  );
```

After a successful run, the command returns a `NOTICE` message containing the
unique [webhook URL](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/webhook/#webhook-url)
that allows you to `POST` events to the source. Copy and store it. You will need
it for the next step.

The URL will have the following format:

```
https://<HOST>/api/webhook/<database>/<schema>/<src_name>
```

If you missed the notice, you can find the URLs for all webhook sources in the
[`mz_internal.mz_webhook_sources`](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_webhook_sources)
system table.

### Access and authentication

{{< warning >}}
Without a `CHECK` statement, **all requests will be accepted**. To prevent bad
actors from injecting data into your source, it is **strongly encouraged** that
you define a `CHECK` statement with your webhook sources.
{{< /warning >}}

The `CHECK` clause defines how to validate each request. At the time of writing,
Segment validates requests by signing them with an HMAC in the `X-Signature`
request header. The HMAC is a hex-encoded SHA1 hash using the secret
from **Step 2.** and the request body. Materialize decodes the signature using
the [`decode`](/sql/functions/#decode) function, getting the raw bytes, and
generate our own HMAC using the [`hmac`](/sql/functions/#hmac) function. If the
two values are equal, then the request is legitimate!

## Step 4. Create a webhook destination in Segment

1. In Segment, go to **Connections > Catalog**.

2. Search and click **Webhooks (Actions)**.

3. Click **Add destination**.

4. Select a data source and click **Next**.

5. Jot a *Destination Name* and click **Create Destination**.

## Step 5. Configure the mapping in Segment

A webhook destination in Segment requires a [data mapping](https://segment.com/blog/data-mapping/)
to send events from the source to the destination. For this guide, the
destination is the Materialize source. Follow these steps to create the correct
mapping:

1. Go to your webhook destination created in the previous step.

2. Click on **Mappings > New Mapping**.

3. Click **Send** and fill the configuration as follows:
   1. In **Select events to map and send**, fill the conditions as you wish.
   2. In **Add test**, select any of the events.
   3. In **Select mappings**, fill the fields as follows:
    Field               | Value
    ------------------- | ----------------------
    Url                 | Use the URL from the [Step 3](#step-3-set-up-a-webhook-source).
    Method              | `POST`
    Batch Size          | `0`
    Headers             | -
    Data                | `$event`
    Enable Batching     | `No`.

4. Click **Test Mapping** and validate the webhook is working.

5. After a succesful test, click **Save**.

  {{< note >}}
  If **Test Mapping** fails in and throws a *"failed to validate the request"* error, it means the shared secret is not right. To fix this, follow this steps:
 1. In **Segment**, go to your webhook destination created in the **Step 4**.
 2. Click **Settings**.
 3. In **Shared Secret**, enter the secret created in the **Step 2**.
 4. Click **Save Changes**.
  {{< /note >}}

## Step 6. Validate incoming data

With the source set up in Materialize and the webhook destination configured in
Segment, you can now query the incoming data:

1. [In the Materialize console](https://console.materialize.com/), navigate to
   the **SQL Shell**.

1. Use SQL queries to inspect and analyze the incoming data:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM segment_source LIMIT 10;
    ```

## Step 7. Transform incoming data

### JSON parsing

Webhook data is ingested as a JSON blob. We recommend creating a parsing view on
top of your webhook source that uses [`jsonb` operators](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/types/jsonb/#operators)
to map the individual fields to columns with the required data types.

### Timestamp handling

We highly recommend using the [`try_parse_monotonic_iso8601_timestamp`](/transform-data/patterns/temporal-filters/#temporal-filter-pushdown)
function when casting from `text` to `timestamp`, which enables [temporal filter
pushdown](https://materialize.com/docs/transform-data/patterns/temporal-filters/#temporal-filter-pushdown).

### Deduplication

With the vast amount of data processed and potential network issues, it's not
uncommon to receive duplicate records. You can use the `DISTINCT ON` clause to
efficiently remove duplicates. For more details, refer to the webhook source
[reference documentation](/sql/create-source/webhook/#handling-duplicated-and-partial-events).

## Next steps

With Materialize ingesting your Segment data, you can start exploring it,
computing real-time results that stay up-to-date as new data arrives, and
serving results efficiently. For more details, check out the
[Segment documentation](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-webhook/) and the
[webhook source reference documentation](/sql/create-source/webhook/).
