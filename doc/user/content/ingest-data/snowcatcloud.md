This guide walks through the steps to ingest data from [SnowcatCloud](https://www.snowcatcloud.com/)
into Materialize using the [Webhook source](/sql/create-source/webhook/).

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have:

- A [SnowcatCloud account](https://app.snowcatcloud.com/register)
- A Snowplow or Analytics.js compatible pipeline set up and running.

## Step 1. (Optional) Create a cluster

{{< note >}}
If you are prototyping and already have a cluster to host your webhook
source (e.g. `quickstart`), **you can skip this step**. For production
scenarios, we recommend separating your workloads into multiple clusters for
[resource isolation](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-cluster/#resource-isolation).
{{< /note >}}

To create a cluster in Materialize, use the [`CREATE CLUSTER` command](/sql/create-cluster):

```sql
CREATE CLUSTER webhooks_cluster (SIZE = '3xsmall');

SET CLUSTER = webhooks_cluster;
```

## Step 2. Create a secret

To validate requests between SnowcatCloud and Materialize, you must create a [secret](/sql/create-secret/):

```sql
CREATE SECRET snowcat_webhook_secret AS '<secret_value>';
```

Change the `<secret_value>` to a unique value that only you know and store it in a secure location.

## Step 3. Set up a webhook source

Using the secret from the previous step, create a [webhook source](/sql/create-source/webhook/)
in Materialize to ingest data from SnowcatCloud. By default, the source will be
created in the active cluster; to use a different cluster, use the `IN
CLUSTER` clause.

```sql
CREATE SOURCE snowcat_source IN CLUSTER webhooks_cluster
  FROM WEBHOOK
    BODY FORMAT JSON
    CHECK (
      WITH (
        HEADERS,
        BODY AS body,
        SECRET snowcat_webhook_secret
      )
      constant_time_eq(headers->'authorization', snowcat_webhook_secret)
);
```

After a successful run, the command returns a `NOTICE` message containing the
unique [webhook URL](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/webhook/#webhook-url)
that allows you to `POST` events to the source. Copy and store it. You will need
it for the next step.

The URL will have the following format:

```
https://<HOST>/api/webhook/<database>/<schema>/<src_name>
```

If you missed the notice, you can find the URLs for all webhook sources in the
[`mz_internal.mz_webhook_sources`](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_webhook_sources)
system table.

### Access and authentication

{{< warning >}}
Without a `CHECK` statement, **all requests will be accepted**. To prevent bad
actors from injecting data into your source, it is **strongly encouraged** that
you define a `CHECK` statement with your webhook sources.
{{< /warning >}}

The above webhook source uses [basic authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#basic_authentication_scheme).
This enables a simple and rudimentary way to grant authorization to your webhook source.

## Step 4. Create a webhook destination in SnowcatCloud

To configure a Materialize webhook as a destination in SnowcatCloud, follow the
steps outlined below:

1.  **Select your SnowcatCloud pipe**

    Identify the pipeline you wish to add Materialize to as a destination.

1.  **Select Materialize as a destination**
    1. Navigate to the destinations section.
    1. Click **Configure** on the **Materialize** destination.

#### Connection settings

On the **Materialize Settings** page:

- **Webhook URL**: Define the endpoint where events will be dispatched by
    SnowcatCloud. Use the URL from **Step 3.**.

- **Secret**: Use the secret created in **Step 2.**.

- **Click Save & Test**: If the webhook is configured successfully, you will see
    a success message and the destination will start `PROVISIONING`; once it is
    `ACTIVE`, all your data will be streaming to Materialize's webhook.

## Step 5. Validate incoming data

With the source set up in Materialize and the webhook destination configured in
SnowcatCloud, you can now query the incoming data:

1. [In the Materialize console](https://console.materialize.com/), navigate to
   the **SQL Shell**.

1. Use SQL queries to inspect and analyze the incoming data:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM segment_source LIMIT 10;
    ```

    Note that while the destination is `PROVISIONING`, you will only see the
    test event.

## Step 6. Transform incoming data

Webhook data is ingested as a JSON blob. We recommend creating a parsing view on
top of your webhook source that uses [`jsonb` operators](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/types/jsonb/#operators)
to map the individual fields to columns with the required data types.

To see what columns are available for your pipeline (enrichments), refer to
the [SnowcatCloud documentation](https://docs.snowcatcloud.com/).

### Timestamp handling

We highly recommend using the [`try_parse_monotonic_iso8601_timestamp`](/transform-data/patterns/temporal-filters/#temporal-filter-pushdown)
function when casting from `text` to `timestamp`, which enables [temporal filter
pushdown](https://materialize.com/docs/transform-data/patterns/temporal-filters/#temporal-filter-pushdown).

### Deduplication

With the vast amount of data processed and potential network issues, it's not
uncommon to receive duplicate records. You can use the `DISTINCT ON` clause to
efficiently remove duplicates. For more details, refer to the webhook source
[reference documentation](/sql/create-source/webhook/#handling-duplicated-and-partial-events).

## Next steps

With Materialize ingesting your SnowcatCloud data, you can start exploring it,
computing real-time results that stay up-to-date as new data arrives, and
serving results efficiently. For more details, check out the
[SnowcatCloud documentation](https://docs.snowcatcloud.com/) and the
[webhook source reference documentation](/sql/create-source/webhook/).
