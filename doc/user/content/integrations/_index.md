[//]: # "TODO(morsapaes) Once #8396 lands, link the page here"

Materialize is **wire-compatible** with PostgreSQL, which means it integrates with most client libraries, ORM frameworks and other third-party tools that support PostgreSQL. This page describes the status, level of support, and usage notes for commonly used and requested Materialize integrations and tools.

{{< note >}}
If there's a tool that you'd like to use with Materialize but is not listed, let us know by submitting a [feature request](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/new?assignees=&labels=A-integration&template=02-feature.yml)!

## Databases

Materialize can efficiently maintain real-time materialized views on top of **Change Data Capture (CDC)** data originating from a database, either by directly consuming its replication stream or via [Debezium](/integrations/debezium/).

### PostgreSQL

Postgres is supported as a [**source**](/overview/key-concepts/#sources), both through the [direct PostgreSQL source](/sql/create-source/postgres/) and through [Debezium](/integrations/debezium/) (via Kafka or Redpanda). Using a PostgreSQL instance as a source requires enabling **logical replication**.

| Service | Support level| Notes |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL _(direct)_ | {{< supportLevel beta >}} | See the [source documentation](/sql/create-source/postgres/) for more details, and the [PostgreSQL CDC guide](/integrations/cdc-postgres/#direct-postgres-source) for a step-by-step breakdown of the integration. | [](#notify) |
| PostgreSQL _(via Debezium)_ | {{< supportLevel production >}} | See the [PostgreSQL CDC guide](/integrations/cdc-postgres/#kafka--debezium) for a step-by-step breakdown of the integration. | [](#notify) |
| Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL | {{< supportLevel beta >}} | See the [Amazon RDS CDC guide](/integrations/aws-rds/) for a step-by-step breakdown of the integration. | [](#notify) |
| GCP Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL | {{< supportLevel beta >}} | See the [GCP Cloud SQL CDC guide](/integrations/gcp-cloud-sql/) for a step-by-step breakdown of the integration. | [](#notify) |
| Amazon Aurora | {{< supportLevel beta >}} | See the [Amazon Aurora CDC guide](/integrations/aws-aurora/) for a step-by-step breakdown of the integration. | [](#notify) |
| Amazon Aurora Serverless | {{< supportLevel researching >}} | Aurora serverless v1 does [not support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.html#aurora-serverless.limitations) logical replication, which is required for PostgreSQL CDC. | [](#notify) |
| Heroku Postgres | {{< supportLevel researching >}} | Heroku Postgres does not support logical replication, which is required for PostgreSQL CDC. Heroku provides [Heroku Data Connectors](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-data-connectors) that may enable interoperability with Materialize, but this hasn't been officially tested. | [](#notify) |
| Azure Database for PostgreSQL | {{< supportLevel beta >}} | See the [Azure Database CDC guide](/integrations/azure-postgres/) for a step-by-step breakdown of the integration. | [](#notify) |
| DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL | {{< supportLevel beta >}} | See the [DO Managed PostgreSQL guide](/integrations/digitalocean-postgres/) for a step-by-step breakdown of the integration. | [](#notify) |
| CrunchyBridge Postgres| {{< supportLevel beta >}} | Logical replication is enabled by default. See the [PostgreSQL CDC guide](/integrations/cdc-postgres/#direct-postgres-source) for a step-by-step breakdown of the integration. | [](#notify) ||

### MySQL

MySQL is indirectly supported as a [**source**](/overview/key-concepts/#sources) through [Debezium](/integrations/debezium/) (via Kafka or Redpanda). Using a MySQL instance as a source requires enabling **row-based replication**.

| Service | Support level | Notes |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MySQL _(direct)_ | {{< supportLevel researching >}} | Not supported yet {{% gh 8078 %}}. Subscribe via "Notify Me" to register interest. | [](#notify) |
| MySQL _(via Debezium)_ | {{< supportLevel production >}} | See the [MySQL CDC guide](/integrations/cdc-mysql/) for a step-by-step breakdown of the integration. | |

### Other databases

{{< note >}}
OLAP databases like Snowflake, BigQuery or Redshift aren't a good fit as a data source in Materialize, as these are typically _consumers_ and not _producers_ of change events.
{{</ note >}}

Debezium has an extensive ecosystem of connectors, but each database has its own quirks. Materialize expects a specific message structure that includes the row data `before` and `after` the change event, which is **not guaranteed** for every connector.

| Service | Support level | Notes |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MongoDB _(via Debezium)_ | {{< supportLevel researching >}} | Not supported yet {{% gh 7289 %}}. Subscribe via "Notify Me" to register interest. | [](#notify) |
| SQL Server _(via Debezium)_ | {{< supportLevel alpha >}} | Supported with [known limitations](https://materializecommunity.slack.com/archives/C0157GZ7UKF/p1646142131506359) unrelated to Materialize. See the [Debezium documentation](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/sqlserver.html) for details on how to configure a SQL Server instance for [CDC](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/sqlserver.html#sqlserver-overview). | [](#notify) |

## Database management tools

### dbt

Materialize integrates with dbt through the [`dbt-materialize`](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/main/misc/dbt-materialize) adapter. The adapter implements custom materializations and macros to **build**, **run** and **version-control** models that transform streaming data in real time.

| Service | Support level | Notes |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dbt Core | {{< supportLevel beta >}} | See the [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/materialize-profile) for more details, and the [dbt + Materialize guide](/integrations/dbt/) for a step-by-step breakdown of the integration. | [](#notify) |
| dbt Cloud | {{< supportLevel in-progress >}} | Not supported yet. We are working with the dbt community to bring native Materialize support to dbt Cloud soon. | [](#notify) |

### SQL clients

üëã _Is there another SQL client you'd like to use with Materialize? Submit a [feature request](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/new?assignees=&labels=A-integration&template=02-feature.yml)._


## Client libraries and ORMs

Applications can use any common language-specific PostgreSQL drivers and PostgreSQL-compatible ORMs to interact with Materialize and **create relations**, **execute queries** and **stream out results**.

{{< note >}}
Client libraries and ORM frameworks tend to run complex introspection queries that may use configuration settings, system tables or features not yet implemented in Materialize. This means that even if PostgreSQL is supported, it's **not guaranteed** that the same integration will work out-of-the-box.
{{</ note >}}

### Client libraries {#libraries-and-drivers}

## Other tools

As a rule of thumb: if a tool has support for PostgreSQL, it _might_ work out-of-the-box with Materialize using the native **PostgreSQL connector**. This will depend on the complexity of the queries each tool runs under the hood, and the configuration settings, system tables and features involved.

The level of support for these tools will improve as we extend the coverage of `pg_catalog` in Materialize {{% gh 2157 %}} and join efforts with each community to make the integrations Just Work‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.
