The Materialize command-line interface (CLI), lets you interact with
Materialize from your terminal.

You can use `mz` to:

  * Enable new regions
  * Run SQL commands against a region
  * Create app passwords
  * Securely manage secrets
  * Invite new users to your organization

## Getting started

1. Install `mz`:

   ```shell
   # On macOS:
   brew install materializeinc/materialize/mz
   # On Ubuntu/Debian:
   curl -fsSL https://dev.materialize.com/apt/materialize.sources | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/materialize.sources
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install materialize-cli
   ```

   See [Installation](installation) for additional installation options.

2. Log in to your Materialize account:

   ```shell
   mz profile init
   ```

   `mz` will attempt to launch your web browser and ask you to log in.

   See [Configuration](configuration) for alternative configuration methods.

3. Show enabled regions in your organization:

   ```shell
   $ mz region list
   ```
   ```
   aws/us-east-1  enabled
   aws/eu-west-1  disabled
   ```

4. Launch a SQL shell connected to one of the enabled regions in your
   organization:

   ```shell
   $ mz sql
   ```
   ```
   Authenticated using profile 'default'.
   Connected to the quickstart cluster.
   psql (14.2)
   Type "help" for help.

   materialize=>
   ```

   You can use the `--region=aws/us-east-1` flag with the name of an enabled region
   in your organization. If you don't yet have an enabled region, use
   [`mz region enable`](reference/region) to enable one.
