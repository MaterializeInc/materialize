You can access Materialize through its "session-less" HTTP API endpoint:

```bash
https://<MZ host address>/api/sql
```

## Details

### General semantics

The API:

- Requires username/password authentication, just as connecting via `psql`.
  Materialize provides you the username and password upon setting up your
  account.
- Requires that you provide the entirety of your request. The API does not
  provide session-like semantics, so there is no way to e.g. interactively use
  transactions.
- Ceases to process requests upon encountering the first error.
- Does not support statements whose semantics rely on sessions or whose state is
  indeterminate at the end of processing, including:
    - `CLOSE`
    - `COPY`
    - `DECLARE`
    - `FETCH`
    - `SUBSCRIBE`

### Transactional semantics

The HTTP API provides two modes with slightly different transactional semantics from one another:

- **Simple**, which mirrors PostgreSQL's [Simple Query][simple-query] protocol.
    - Supports a single query, but the single query string may contain multiple
      statements, e.g. `SELECT 1; SELECT 2;`
    - Treats all statements as in an implicit transaction unless other
      transaction control is invoked.
- **Extended**, which mirrors PostgreSQL's [Extended Query][extended-query] protocol.
    - Supports multiple queries, but only one statement per query string.
    - Supports parameters.
    - Eagerly commits DDL (e.g. `CREATE TABLE`) in implicit transactions, but
      not DML (e.g. `INSERT`).

## Usage

### Endpoint

```
https://<MZ host address>/api/sql
```

Accessing the endpoint requires [basic authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#basic_authentication_scheme). Reuse the same credentials as with `psql`:

* **User ID:** Your email to access Materialize.
* **Password:** Your app password.

### Input format

#### Simple

The request body is a JSON object containing a key, `query`, which specifies the
SQL string to execute. `query` may contain multiple SQL statements separated by
semicolons.

```json
{
    "query": "select * from a; select * from b;"
}
```

#### Extended

The request body is a JSON object containing a key `queries`, whose value is
array of objects, whose structure is:

Key | Value
----|------
`query` | A SQL string containing one statement to execute
`params` | An optional array of text values to be used as the parameters to `query`. _null_ values are converted to _null_ values in Materialize. Note that all parameter values' elements must be text or _null_; the API will not accept JSON numbers.

```json
{
    "queries": [
        { "query": "select * from a;" },
        { "query": "select a + $1 from a;", "params": ["100"] }
        { "query": "select a + $1 from a;", "params": [null] }
    ]
}
```

### Output format

The output format is a JSON object with one key, `results`, whose value is
an array of the following:

Result | JSON value
---------------------|------------
Rows | `{"rows": <2D array of JSON-ified results>, "col_names": <array of text>, "notices": <array of notices>}`
Error | `{"error": <Error string from execution>, "notices": <array of notices>}`
Ok | `{"ok": <tag>, "notices": <array of notices>}`

Each committed statement returns exactly one of these values; e.g. in the case
of "complex responses", such as `INSERT INTO...RETURNING`, the presence of a
`"rows"` object implies `"ok"`.

The `"notices"` array is present in all types of results and contains any
diagnostic messages that were generated during execution of the query. It has
the following structure:

```
{"severity": <"warning"|"notice"|"debug"|"info"|"log">, "message": <informational message>}
```

Note that the returned values include the results of statements which were
ultimately rolled back because of an error in a later part of the transaction.
You must parse the results to understand which statements ultimately reflect
the resultant state.

#### TypeScript definition

You can model these with the following TypeScript definitions:

```typescript
interface Simple {
    query: string;
}

interface ExtendedRequest {
    query: string;
    params?: (string | null)[];
}

interface Extended {
    queries: ExtendedRequest[];
}

type SqlRequest = Simple | Extended;

interface Notice {
	message: string;
	severity: string;
}

type SqlResult =
  | {
	tag: string;
	rows: any[][];
	col_names: string[];
	notices: Notice[];
} | {
	ok: string;
	notices: Notice[];
} | {
	error: string;
	notices: Notice[];
};
```

## Examples
### Run a transaction

Use the [extended input format](#extended) to run a transaction:
```bash
curl 'https://<MZ host address>/api/sql' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --user '<username>:<passsword>' \
    --data '{
        "queries": [
            { "query": "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t (a int);" },
            { "query": "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS s (a int);" },
            { "query": "BEGIN;" },
            { "query": "INSERT INTO t VALUES ($1), ($2)", "params": ["100", "200"] },
            { "query": "COMMIT;" },
            { "query": "BEGIN;" },
            { "query": "INSERT INTO s VALUES ($1), ($2)", "params": ["9", null] },
            { "query": "COMMIT;" }
        ]
    }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {"ok": "CREATE TABLE", "notices": []},
    {"ok": "CREATE TABLE", "notices": []},
    {"ok": "BEGIN", "notices": []},
    {"ok": "INSERT 0 2", "notices": []},
    {"ok": "COMMIT", "notices": []},
    {"ok": "BEGIN", "notices": []},
    {"ok": "INSERT 0 2", "notices": []},
    {"ok": "COMMIT", "notices": []}
  ]
}
```

### Run a query

Use the [simple input format](#simple) to run a query:
```bash
curl 'https://<MZ host address>/api/sql' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --user '<username>:<passsword>' \
    --data '{
        "query": "SELECT t.a + s.a AS cross_add FROM t CROSS JOIN s; SELECT a FROM t WHERE a IS NOT NULL;"
    }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
        "tag": "SELECT 4",
        "rows": [[null],[null],[109],[209]],
        "col_names": ["cross_add"],
        "notices": []
    },
    {
        "tag": "SELECT 2",
        "rows":[[100],[200]],
        "col_names":["a"],
        "notices": []
    }
  ]
}
```
