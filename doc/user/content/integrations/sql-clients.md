Materialize is **wire-compatible** with PostgreSQL, which means it integrates
with many SQL clients that support PostgreSQL (see [Tools and Integrations](/integrations/#sql-clients)).
In this guide, we’ll cover how to connect to your Materialize region using
common SQL clients.

## `psql`

{{< warning >}}
Not all features of `psql` are supported by Materialize yet, including some backslash meta-commands {{% gh 9721 %}}.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab "macOS">}}

Start by double-checking whether you already have `psql` installed:

```shell
psql --version
```

Assuming you’ve installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```shell
brew install libpq
```

Then symlink the `psql` binary to your `/usr/local/bin` directory:

```shell
brew link --force libpq
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Linux">}}

Start by double-checking whether you already have `psql` installed:

```shell
psql --version
```

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client
```

The `postgresql-client` package includes only the client binaries, not the PostgreSQL server.

For other Linux distributions, check out the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/).

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Windows">}}

Start by double-checking whether you already have `psql` installed:

```shell
psql --version
```

Download and install the [PostgreSQL installer](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) certified by EDB.

## DBeaver

**Minimum requirements:** DBeaver 23.1.3

To connect to Materialize using [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.com/docs/wiki/),
follow the documentation to [create a connection](https://dbeaver.com/docs/wiki/Create-Connection/)
and use the **Materialize database driver** with the credentials provided in the
Materialize console.

The Materialize database driver depends on the [PostgreSQL JDBC driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html).
If you don't have the driver installed locally, DBeaver will prompt you to
automatically download and install the most recent version.

#### Connect to a specific cluster

By default, Materialize connects to the [pre-installed `quickstart` cluster](/sql/show-clusters/#pre-installed-clusters).
To connect to a specific [cluster](/get-started/key-concepts/#clusters), you must
define a bootstrap query in the connection initialization settings.

<br>

1. Click on **Connection details**.

1. Click on **Connection initialization settings**.

1. Under **Bootstrap queries**, click **Configure** and add a new SQL query that
sets the active cluster for the connection:

    ```sql
    SET cluster = other_cluster;
    ```

## DataGrip

To connect to Materialize using [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datagrip/connecting-to-a-database.html),
follow the documentation to [create a connection](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datagrip/connecting-to-a-database.html)
and use the **PostgreSQL database driver** with the credentials provided in the
Materialize UI.

{{< note >}}
As we work on extending the coverage of `pg_catalog` in Materialize {{% gh 9720 %}}, you must [turn off automatic database introspection](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360010694760/comments/360003100820) in DataGrip to connect.
