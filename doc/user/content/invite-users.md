You must be an Admin in your organization to invite new users.
{{</ note >}}

1. [Login to the Materialize console](https://console.materialize.com/).

1. Navigate to Account > Account Settings > Users.

1. Click **Invite User** and fill in the user information.

1. Select *Organization Admin* or *Organization Member* depending on what level of console access the user needs:

    - **Organization Admin**: Can invite new users, edit account information,
    and edit account security information.
    - **Organization Member**: Can login to the console.

    These roles do not refer to RBAC roles and privileges and refer to
    actions users can take in the Materialize Console.

2. Click the **Invite** button at the bottom right section of the screen.

   Materialize will email the user with a verification link. The user will
   verify their email and create a password for their account. The user will
   then be able to login to the Materialize console.
