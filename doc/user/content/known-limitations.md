This document applies to Materialize {{< version >}}.

The following links describe features that Materialize does not yet support, but
plans to in future releases. If any of these issues impact you, feel free to let
us know on the linked-to GitHub issue.

For a complete and current overview, check out our [`known-limitations`
tag](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aknown-limitation).

## SQL

### Types

- Numeric precision is not always equivalent to PostgreSQL {{% gh 1824 %}}
- Numeric to float conversions are susceptible to floating point errors {{% gh 1102 %}}

### Performance

- `ANY` and `ALL` queries generate suboptimal plans {{% gh 744 %}}

### Functions

- Materialize does not support [window functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-window.html). In some cases, you may be able to achieve the desired results with [temporal filters](https://materialize.com/temporal-filters/) or the [TOP K by group](../sql/idioms#top-k-by-group) idiom instead. {{% gh 213 %}}

### Common table expressions (CTEs)

- CTEs only support `SELECT` queries. {{% gh 4867 %}}
- Materialize inlines the CTE where it's referenced, which could cause
  unexpected performance characteristics for especially complex expressions. {{%
  gh 4867 %}}
- `WITH RECURSIVE` CTEs are not available yet. {{% gh 2516 %}}

## Sources & Sinks

### Kafka

- Protobuf data for Kafka sinks is not supported {{% gh 1541 %}}
- JSON-encoded data for Kafka sinks is not supported {{% gh 1540 %}}

### Kinesis

- Consistent Kinesis sources are not supported {{% gh 2191 %}}
- Enhanced fan-out Kinesis consumers are not supported {{% gh 2192 %}}
- Reading from a Kinesis stream as of a sequence number or timestamp is not supported {{% gh 2294 %}}
- Kinesis sinks are not supported {{% gh 2372 %}}

### File sources

None right now!

### Regex formatting

- Regex columns cannot be set as nullable {{% gh 1685 %}}

## Deployment

### Performance

- Slow queries can impact other, unrelated queries {{% gh 1956 %}}

### Networking

- Hostnames that resolve to multiple addresses are not supported {{% gh 502 %}}

### Monitoring & Debugging

- No report exists to show memory usage for indexes {{% gh 1532 %}}
