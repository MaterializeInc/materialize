{{< note >}}
Configuring and managing access control in Materialize requires **administrator** privileges.
{{</ note >}}

Access control in Materialize is configured at two levels: access to the
[Materialize console](https://console.materialize.com/) and access within the
database. The privileges assigned on user invitation have implications at both
levels, so we recommend carefully evaluating your access control needs ahead of
expanding the number of users in your Materialize organization.

## Account management

### Inviting users

As an **administrator**, you can invite new users via the Materialize console.
Depending on the level of access each user should have, you can assign them
`Organization Admin` or `Organization Member` privileges.

   - `Organization Admin`: can perform adminstration tasks in the console, like
     inviting new users, editing account and security information, or managing
     billing. Admins have _superuser_ privileges in the database.

   - `Organization Member`: can log in to the console and has restricted access
     to the database, depending  on the privileges defined via
     [role-based access control (RBAC)](#role-based-access-control-rbac).

These privileges primarily determine a user's **access level to the console**,
but also have implications in the **default access level to the database**.
More granular permissions within the database must be handled separately using
[role-based access control (RBAC)](#role-based-access-control-rbac).

make these more noticeable."

To invite users to your Materialize organization, follow [this step-by-step guide](/manage/access-control/invite-users).

### Configuring single sign-on (SSO)

As an **administrator** of a Materialize organization, you can configure single
sign-on (SSO) as an additional layer of account security using your existing
[SAML](https://auth0.com/blog/how-saml-authentication-works/)- or
[OpenID Connect](https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-openid-connect-oidc)-based
identity provider. This ensures that all users can securely log in to the
Materialize console using the same authentication scheme and credentials across
all systems in your organization.

To configure SSO for your Materialize organization, follow [this step-by-step
guide](/manage/access-control/sso).

[//]: # "NOTE(morsapaes) This sits kind of awkward in here, but feels like the
best place to plug it. Need to add some more meat if we keep it."

### Using an external secret store

Although Materialize does not integrate directly with external secret stores,
it‚Äôs possible to manage this integration via [Terraform](/manage/terraform).

Check the [Terraform documentation](/manage/terraform/#external-secret-stores)
for more details on how to integrate with common external secret stores, like
HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

## Role-based access control (RBAC)

[//]: # "NOTE(morsapaes) These instructions assume that RBAC is enabled at the
time of region creation. For existing regions, we assume that migration to RBAC
is whitegloved."

The default level of access to the database is determined by the
organization-level role a user is assigned on invitation (`Organization Admin`
or `Organization Member`). When an invited user logs in for the first time
(and only then), a [role](./rbac/#roles) with the same name as their e-mail
address is created.

The first user in an organization, and subsequently any user that is assigned
`Organization Admin`, is a database _superuser_, and has unrestricted access to
all resources in a Materialize region. Users that are assigned `Organization
Member` are restricted to a [default set of basic privileges](#modifying-default-privileges)
that need to be configured and modified via role-based access control (RBAC).

RBAC allows you to configure granular access control to the resources in your
Materialize region through a hierarchy of [roles](/sql/grant-role/) and
[privileges](/sql/grant-privilege/). For a deep-dive into how RBAC works in
Materialize, check [Role-based access control (RBAC)](./rbac).

### Configuring basic RBAC

{{< warning >}}
Here be dragons. üêâ This setup is **not recommended** unless you are trialing
Materialize.
{{< /warning >}}

If you're just getting started and haven't yet decided on an [RBAC strategy](#configuring-advanced-rbac)
for your organization, we recommend [modifying default privileges](#modifying-default-privileges)
or ‚Äî if you just need to move fast and break things ‚Äî [inviting users as administrators](#inviting-users-as-administrators).

#### Modifying default privileges

Every Materialize region has a `PUBLIC` system role that determines the default
privileges available to all other roles. On creation, users are automatically
granted membership in `PUBLIC`, and inherit the privileges assigned to it. By
default, members of this role (and therefore **all users**) have the following
[privileges](/sql/grant-privilege/#privilege):

Privilege                            | Scope     |
-------------------------------------|-----------|
`USAGE`                              | All types, all system catalog schemas, the `materialize.public` schema, the `materialize` database, and the `quickstart` cluster.|
`SELECT`                             | All system catalog objects.  |

This means that new, non-administrator users have limited access to resources in
a Materialize region, and don't have the ability to e.g., create new clusters,
databases, or schemas. To modify the default privileges available to all other
roles in a Materialize region, you can use the [`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`](/sql/alter-default-privileges/)
command.

```sql
# Use SHOW ROLES to list existing roles in the system, which are 1:1 with invited users
SHOW ROLES;

-- Example: grant read-only access to all object types, to all roles in the
-- system via the PUBLIC role For PostgreSQL compatibility reasons, TABLE is
-- the object type for sources, views, tables and materialized views
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ALL ROLES GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO PUBLIC;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ALL ROLES GRANT USAGE ON DATABASES TO PUBLIC;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ALL ROLES GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMAS TO PUBLIC;
```

#### Inviting users as administrators

The path of least resistance to setting up RBAC is...not setting it up. If you
invite all users as `Organization Admin`, all users will have the _superuser_
role.

Keep in mind that you will be giving all users unrestricted access to all
resources in your Materialize region, as well as all features in the
Materialize console. While this might be a viable solution when trialing
Materialize with a small number of users, it can be **hard to revert** once you
decide to roll out a RBAC strategy for your Materialize organization.

As an alternative, you can approximate the set of privileges of a _superuser_ by
instead modifying the default privileges to be wildly permissive:

```sql
-- Use SHOW ROLES to list existing roles in the system, which are 1:1 with invited users
SHOW ROLES;

-- Example: approximate full-blown admin access by modifying the default
-- privileges inherited by all roles via the PUBLIC role
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA materialize.public TO PUBLIC;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE materialize TO PUBLIC;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA materialize.public TO PUBLIC;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON CLUSTER default TO PUBLIC;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA materialize.public TO PUBLIC;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TYPES IN SCHEMA materialize.public TO PUBLIC;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SECRETS IN SCHEMA materialize.public TO PUBLIC;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL CONNECTIONS IN SCHEMA materialize.public TO PUBLIC;

ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ALL ROLES IN SCHEMA materialize.public GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLES TO PUBLIC;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ALL ROLES IN SCHEMA materialize.public GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TYPES TO PUBLIC;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ALL ROLES IN SCHEMA materialize.public GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SECRETS TO PUBLIC;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ALL ROLES IN SCHEMA materialize.public GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON CONNECTIONS TO PUBLIC;
```

It's important to note that, while [`GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES`](/sql/grant-privilege/)
applies to all objects that exist when the grant is run, [`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`](/sql/alter-default-privileges/)
applies to objects created in the future (aka future grants).

### Configuring advanced RBAC

There is no one-size-fits-all solution for RBAC: the right strategy will depend
on your team size, and existing security policies. Being able to create an
unbounded amount of custom roles with custom privileges and structural
hierarchy can be overwhelming, so following are examples on how to roll out
three common RBAC strategies: user roles, functional roles, and environment
roles.

#### User roles

If your Materialize user base is small and you don't expect it to grow
significantly over time, you can grant and revoke privileges directly to/from
user roles.

```sql
-- Use SHOW ROLES to list existing roles in the system.
SHOW ROLES;

-- Example: grant usage on a specific database & schema to individual roles
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE d1 TO "user1@company.com", "user2@company.com";
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA d1.s1 TO "user1@company.com", "user2@company.com";
GRANT USAGE ON CLUSTER c1 to "user1@company.com", "user2@company.com";

-- Example: grant individual roles permission to create clusters and databases
GRANT CREATECLUSTER, CREATEDB on system to "user1@company.com";
```

This strategy allows you to skip setting up a complex hierarchy of roles
upfront, at the cost of manual work. As you might expect, this strategy does
not scale, so you might want to rethink your RBAC strategy if your user base
grows past a reasonable number (say, 10+).

#### Functional roles

If your Materialize user base is made up of business functions that clearly map
to distinct access profiles, a common strategy is to map those functions to
roles in your RBAC hierarchy. You can then grant and revoke privileges to/from
functional roles, and any user that is a member of that role will inherit
them.

As an example, Data Engineers might need a larger scope of permissions to create
and evolve the data model, while Data Analysts might only need read permissions
to query Materialize using BI tools.

```sql
-- Use SHOW ROLES to list existing roles in the system, which are 1:1 with invited users
SHOW ROLES;

-- Step 1: create the data_analyst role
CREATE ROLE data_analyst;

-- Step 2: grant usage on the database & schema to the data_analyst role
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE d1 TO data_analyst;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA d1.s1 TO data_analyst;
GRANT USAGE ON CLUSTER c1 to data_analyst;

-- Step 3: grant select to all objects in the d1.s1 schema to the data_analyst role.
-- For pre-existing objects in the schema (skip if there are none!)
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA d1.s1 TO data_analyst;
-- For future objects created in the schema
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ALL ROLES IN SCHEMA d1.s1 GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO data_analyst;

-- Step 4: create the data_engineer role
CREATE ROLE data_engineer;

-- Step 5: grant usage & create on the database & schema to the data_engineer role
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON DATABASE d1 TO data_engineer;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA d1.s1 TO data_engineer;
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON CLUSTER c1 to data_engineer;

-- Step 6: grant all privileges to all objects in the d1.s1 schema to the data_engineer role
-- For pre-existing objects in the schema (skip if there are none!)
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA d1.s1 TO data_engineer;
-- For future objects created in the schema
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ALL ROLES IN SCHEMA d1.s1 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLES TO data_engineer;

-- Step 7: add member(s) to the respective role
GRANT data_analyst TO "user1@company.com", "user2@company.com";
GRANT data_engineer TO "user3@company.com";
```

This strategy allows you to more efficiently manage permissions for multiple
users at a time, as well as create an intuitive hierarchy based on each
functional role's expected usage of Materialize.

#### Environment roles

[//]: # "NOTE(morsapaes) We are pointing users to different links when we ask
them to reach out, across the documentation. Standardize on one."

{{< warning >}}
This strategy relies on the `NOINHERIT` role attribute and the `SET ROLE`
command, which are unimplemented in Materialize {{% gh 19165 %}} {{% gh 19942 %}}.
Please [reach out](https://materialize.com/contact/) if you're
interested in this strategy!
{{< /warning >}}

If your Materialize user base frequently switches between multiple development
environments, you might want to ensure that users don't accidentally run
commands in the wrong environment e.g., production. You can create an
environment-specific role with the `NOINHERIT` attribute, which prevents other
roles from inheriting it. This means that users have to explicitly run e.g.,
`SET ROLE production` before being able to run any commands in the specified
environment.

```sql
-- Step 1: create the dev and prod roles
CREATE ROLE dev;
CREATE ROLE prod NOINHERIT;

-- Step 2: grant usage & create on the respective database & cluster for each role
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE d_dev TO dev;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE d_prod TO prod;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON CLUSTER c_dev TO dev;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON CLUSTER c_prod TO prod;

-- Step 3: grant all privileges to all objects on the database to the respective roles
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ALL ROLES IN DATABASE d_dev GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLES TO dev;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ALL ROLES IN DATABASE d_prod GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLES TO prod;

-- Step 4: add member(s) to the respective role - user1 has both prod & dev access, user2 has only dev access
GRANT dev TO "user1@company.com", "user2@company.com";
GRANT prod TO "user1@company.com";

-- To run queries against the prod database and cluster, user1 will first need to run
SET ROLE prod;
```

This strategy allows you to add an extra layer of access control to your
critical environments, and ensure that any user with privileges to perform
destructive actions is performing them intentionally in that specific
environment. It's like `sudo` for your database!

views here. Need to think about where to work these in."
