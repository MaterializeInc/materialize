### Monitoring

You can monitor the performance and overall health of your Materialize region.
To help you get started, the following guides are available:

- [Datadog](/manage/monitor/datadog/)

- [Grafana](/manage/monitor/grafana/)

### Alerting

After setting up a monitoring tool, you can configure alert rules. Alert rules
send a notification when a metric surpasses a threshold. This will help you
prevent operational incidents. For alert rules guidelines, see
[Alerting](/manage/monitor/alerting/).
