This section covers monitoring and alerting for Self-Managed Materialize.

### Monitoring

You can monitor the performance and overall health of your Self-Manaed
Materialize.

To help you get started, the following guides are available:

- [Grafana using Prometheus](/manage/monitor/self-managed/prometheus/)

- [Datadog using Prometheus SQL Exporter](/manage/monitor/self-managed/datadog/)


### Alerting

After setting up a monitoring tool, you can configure alert rules. Alert rules
send a notification when a metric surpasses a threshold. This will help you
prevent operational incidents. For alert rules guidelines, see
[Alerting](/manage/monitor/self-managed/alerting/).
