## Memory

Materialize stores the majority of its state in-memory, and works best when the streamed data
can be reduced in some way. For example, if you know that only a subset of your rows and columns
are relevant for your queries, it helps to avoid materializing sources or views until you've
expressed this to the system (we can avoid stashing that data, which can in some cases dramatically
reduce the memory footprint).

To minimize the chances that Materialize runs out of memory in a production environment,
we recommend you make additional memory available to Materialize via a SSD-backed
swap file or swap partition.
