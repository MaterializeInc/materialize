Once you're familiar with the basics, it's time to explore how to use Materialize for different use cases, and with different stacks.

[//]: # "TODO(morsapaes) Replace bullet list with a nicer table once old demos are swapped for new ones"

* [Build a real-time analytics dashboard]

* [Run SQL on streaming logs]

* [Replace a microservice with a SQL query]

If you run into a snag or need support as you follow along, join the [Materialize community Slack](https://materialize.com/s/chat) or [open an issue](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/demos/issues/new)!

## Setup

The quickstarts are containerized and should run end-to-end with no modifications. To get started, make sure you have installed:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

We recommend running Docker with at least **2 CPUs** and **8GB** of memory, so double check your [resource preferences](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/#preferences) before moving on.
