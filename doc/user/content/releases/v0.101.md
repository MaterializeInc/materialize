## v0.101

#### Sources and sinks

* Allow configuring the initial and the maximum snapshot size for [load generator sources](/sql/create-source/load-generator/)
  via the new `AS OF` and `UP TO` `WITH` options.

#### SQL

* Disallow using the [`mz_now()` function](/sql/functions/now_and_mz_now/) in
  all positions and dependencies of `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`
  statements.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Extend `pg_catalog` and `information_schema` system catalog coverage for
  compatibility with Metaplane {{% gh 27155%}}.

* Add details to errors related to insufficient privileges pointing to the
  missing permissions {{% gh 27176 %}}.

* Avoid resetting sink statistics when using the [`ALTER CONNECTION`](/sql/alter-connection/)
  command {{% gh 27236 %}}.

* Modify the output of the [`SHOW CREATE SOURCE`](/sql/show-create-source/)
  command for [load generator sources](/sql/create-source/load-generator/) to
  always include the `FOR ALL TABLES` clause, which is required {{% gh 27250 %}}.
