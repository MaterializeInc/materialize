## v0.107

#### Sources and sinks

* Support exporting data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) using [AWS connections](/sql/create-connection/#aws)
  and the [`COPY TO`](/sql/copy-to/) command. While Materialize does not natively
  support Google Cloud Platform (GCP) connections, GCS is interoperable with
  Amazon S3 (via the [XML API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/interoperability)),
  which allows GCP users to take advantage of [S3 bulk exports](/sql/copy-to/#copy-to-s3)
  also for GCS.

#### SQL

* Add the [`@>` and `<@` operators](/sql/types/list/#list-containment), which
  allow checking if a list contains the elements of another list. Like
  [array containment operators in PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html#FUNCTIONS-ARRAY),
  list containment operators in Materialize **do not** account for duplicates.

  ```mzsql
  SELECT LIST[7,3,1] @> LIST[1,3,3,3,3,7] AS contains;
  ```
  ```nofmt
   contains
  ----------
   t
  ```

* Add `database_name` and `search_path` to the
  [mz_internal.mz_recent_activity_log](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_recent_activity_log)
  system catalog view. These columns show the value of the `database` and
  `search_path` configuration parameters at execution time, respectively.

* Add `connection_id` to the [mz_internal.mz_sessions](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_sessions)
  system catalog table. This column shows the connection ID of the session, which
  is unique for active sessions and corresponds to `pg_backend_pid()`.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Move the `PROGRESS TOPIC REPLICATION FACTOR` option to the `CREATE CONNECTION`
  command for [Kafka connections](/sql/create-connection/#kafka)
  {{% gh 27931 %}}. The progress topic is a property of the connection, not the
  source or sink.
