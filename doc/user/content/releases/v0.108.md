## v0.108

#### Sources and sinks

* Allow specifying the message key format and the message value format
  separately in [Kafka sinks](/sql/create-sink/kafka/), using the new `KEY
  FORMAT ... VALUE FORMAT ...` option.

* Support including a header row in `CSV` files exported using [S3 bulk exports](/sql/copy-to/#copy-to-s3).

  ```mzsql
  COPY some_view TO 's3://mz-to-snow/csv/'
  WITH (
      AWS CONNECTION = aws_role_assumption,
      FORMAT = 'csv',
      HEADER = true
    );
  ```

#### SQL

* Add `hydration_time` to the [`mz_internal.mz_compute_hydration_statuses`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_compute_hydration_statuses)
  system catalog view. This column shows the amount of time it took for a
  dataflow-powered object to hydrate (i.e., be backfilled with any pre-existing
  data).

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Disallow creating sinks that directly depend on system catalog objects {{% gh 28122 %}}.
