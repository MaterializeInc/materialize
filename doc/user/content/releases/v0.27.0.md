title: "Materialize v0.27.0"
date: 2022-11-01

v0.27.0 is the first cloud-native release of Materialize. It contains
substantial breaking changes from [v0.26 LTS].

## Changes

* Add [clusters](/sql/create-cluster) and [cluster
  replicas](/sql/create-cluster-replica/).

* Require associating indexes with a cluster.

* Remove the `MATERIALIZED` keyword as shorthand for `CREATE DEFAULT INDEX`.

  * Remove `CREATE MATERIALIZED SOURCE` syntax.
  * Remove the `materialized` column from the output of `SHOW FULL SOURCES`.

* Add recorded views (which will be conflated with materialized views in an
  upcoming release {{% gh 13663 %}}).

* Add secrets.

* Add connections.

* Ingest and persist sources. This removes the single-materialization limitation
  for sources. Sources can always be queried directly.

* Require the use of connections with sources and sinks.

* Allow provisioning the size of a source or sink.

* Change sinks to have exactly-once behavior by default.

## Upgrade guide

Following are several examples of how to adapt source and view definitions
from Materialize v0.26 LTS for Materialize v0.27:

### Authenticated Kafka source

Change from:

```sql
CREATE SOURCE kafka_sasl
  FROM KAFKA BROKER 'broker.tld:9092' TOPIC 'top-secret' WITH (
      security_protocol = 'SASL_SSL',
      sasl_mechanisms = 'PLAIN',
      sasl_username = '<BROKER_USERNAME>',
      sasl_password = '<BROKER_PASSWORD>'
  )
  FORMAT AVRO USING CONFLUENT SCHEMA REGISTRY 'https://schema-registry.tld' WITH (
      username = '<SCHEMA_REGISTRY_USERNAME>',
      password = '<SCHEMA_REGISTRY_PASSWORD>'
  );
```

to:

```sql
CREATE SECRET kafka_password AS '<BROKER_PASSWORD>';
CREATE SECRET csr_password AS '<SCHEMA_REGISTRY_PASSWORD>';
CREATE CONNECTION kafka FOR KAFKA
    BROKER 'broker.tld:9092',
    SASL MECHANISMS 'PLAIN',
    SASL USERNAME 'materialize',
    SASL PASSWORD SECRET kafka_password;
CREATE CONNECTION csr
  FOR CONFLUENT SCHEMA REGISTRY
    USERNAME = '<SCHEMA_REGISTRY_USERNAME>',
    PASSWORD = SECRET csr_password;
CREATE SOURCE kafka_top_secret FROM
    KAFKA CONNECTION kafka
    FORMAT AVRO USING CONFLUENT SCHEMA REGISTRY CONNECTION csr;
```

### Materialized view

Change from:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW v AS SELECT ...
```

to:

```sql
CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT ...
CREATE DEFAULT INDEX ON v
```

## Materialized source

Change from:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED SOURCE src ...
```

to:

```sql
CREATE SOURCE src ...
```

If you are performing point lookups on `src` directly, consider building an
index on `src` directly:

```
CREATE INDEX on src (lookup_col1, lookup_col2)
```
