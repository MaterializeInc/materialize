## Changes

* Fix a bug that could cause updates in [sinks](/sql/create-sink) to appear as
  two separate records, instead of consolidated into a single update record {{%
  gh 15748 %}}. Previously, updates for multiple keys that occurred at the same
  timestamp would either emit a deletion tombstone followed by a record with the
  new value (`ENVELOPE UPSERT`), or a `{"before": "OLDVALUE", "after": null}`
  record followed by a `{"before": null, "after": "NEWVALUE"}` record (`ENVELOPE
  DEBEZIUM`).

* Improve error message for unsupported types in the
  [PostgreSQL source](/sql/create-source/postgres/), specifying the table and
  column containing an unsupported type:

  ```sql
  CREATE SOURCE pg_source
	FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION pg_connection (PUBLICATION 'mz_source')
	FOR ALL TABLES
	WITH (SIZE = '3xsmall');

	ERROR:  column "person.current_mood" uses unrecognized type
	DETAIL:  type with OID 211538 is unknown
	HINT:  You may be using an unsupported type in Materialize, such as an enum. Try excluding the table from the publication.
  ```

  Fine-grained control for casting unsupported types into valid
  [Materialize types](/sql/types/) is a work in progress {{% gh 15716 %}}.

* When using both signed and unsigned integers as inputs to a function, cast the
  inputs to a larger lossless type rather than [`double`](/sql/types/float). For
  example, when determining equality between [`integer`](/sql/types/integer)
  (32-bit signed integer) and [`uint4`](/sql/types/uint) (32-bit unsigned
  integer), both values are now cast to [`bigint`](/sql/types/integer)
  (64-bit signed integer). Previously both values would be cast to
  [`double`](/sql/types/double) (64-bit floating point number).

* Improve the performance of DDL statements, especially when many DDL statements
  are run within the same 24 hour period.

* Add an `xlarge` size for sources and sinks.
