## v0.31.0

* **Breaking change.** Fix a bug that caused `NULLIF` to be incorrectly
    converted to `COALESCE` {{% gh 15943 %}}. Existing views and materialized
    views using `NULLIF` must be manually dropped and recreated.

* Include the replica status in the output of [`SHOW CLUSTER REPLICAS`](/sql/show-cluster-replicas/)
  as a new column named `ready`, which indicates if a cluster replica is
  online (`t`) or not (`f`).

* Improve the output of [`EXPLAIN`](/sql/explain/) to make the printing of index
  lookups consistent regardless of whether the explained query uses the fast
  path or not. For both cases, the output will look similar to:

  ```nofmt
  ReadExistingIndex materialize.public.t1 lookup values [("l2"); ("l3")]
  ```

* Fix a bug where subsources were counted towards resource limits for existing
  sources {{% gh 15958 %}}. This resulted in an error for users of the PostgreSQL
  source if the number of replicated tables exceeded the default value for
  `max_sources` (25).
