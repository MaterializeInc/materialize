## Changes

* Add support for replicating tables that contain unsupported types in the
  [PostgreSQL source](/sql/create-source/postgres/), using the new `TEXT
  COLUMNS` option:

  ```sql
  CREATE SOURCE mz_source
	FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION pg_connection (
	  PUBLICATION 'mz_source',
	  TEXT COLUMNS (tbl.col_of_unsupported_type)
	) FOR ALL TABLES
  WITH (SIZE = '3xsmall');
  ```

  Any columns specified via this option will be treated as `text` in
  Materialize regardless of the original PostgreSQL type. Examples of
  unsupported types that can now be ingested are `enum`,
  arbitrary precision `numeric`, `money`, and `citext`.

* Improve error message for unexpected or mismatched type catalog errors,
  specifying the catalog item type:

  ```sql
  DROP VIEW mz_table;

  ERROR:  "materialize.public.mz_table" is a table not a view
  ```

* Fix a bug in the [`#>>` `jsonb` operator](/sql/types/jsonb/#operators) that
  caused an error when specifying an array index that does not exist, instead
  of returning `NULL` {{% gh 15978 %}}.

* Fix a bug where relations in `pg_catalog` and `information_schema` would
  contain information about all databases, rather than just the current
  database {{% gh 15841 %}}.

* **Alpha feature.** Add support for
  [AWS PrivateLink connections](/sql/create-connection/#aws-privatelink),
  which establish links to
  [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) services.
