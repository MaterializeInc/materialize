## v0.33.0

* Add support for connecting to Kafka brokers using an [SSH tunnel connection](/sql/create-connection/#ssh-tunnel)
to an SSH bastion server.


```sql
CREATE CONNECTION kafka_connection TO KAFKA (
	BROKERS (
		'broker1:9092' USING SSH TUNNEL ssh_connection,
		'broker2:9092' USING SSH TUNNEL ssh_connection
		)
);
```

* Add `mz_internal.mz_source_status` and `mz_internal.mz_sink_status` to the
  system catalog. These views expose the current state of each source and sink
  in the system, including potential error messages.

* Add [`mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_metrics`](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_cluster_replica_metrics) to the system
  catalog. This table records the last known CPU and RAM utilization statistics
  for all processes of all extant cluster replicas.
