## v0.33.0

* Add support for connecting to Kafka brokers using an [SSH tunnel connection](/sql/create-connection/#ssh-tunnel)
to an SSH bastion server.


  ```sql
  CREATE CONNECTION kafka_connection TO KAFKA (
    BROKERS (
      'broker1:9092' USING SSH TUNNEL ssh_connection,
      'broker2:9092' USING SSH TUNNEL ssh_connection
      )
  );
  ```

* Add [`mz_internal.mz_source_status`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_source_statuses) and
  [`mz_internal.mz_source_status_history`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_source_status_history)
  to the system catalog. These objects respectively expose the current
  and historical state for each source in the system, including potential
  error messages and additional metadata helpful for debugging.

* Add [`mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_metrics`](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_cluster_replica_metrics) to the system
  catalog. This table records the last known CPU and RAM utilization statistics
  for all processes of all extant cluster replicas.
