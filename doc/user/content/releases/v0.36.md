## v0.36.0

* Add `mz_internal.mz_sink_status` and `mz_internal.mz_sink_status_history`
  to the system catalog. These objects respectively expose the current and
  historical state for each sink in the system, including potential error
  messages and additional metadata helpful for debugging.

* Add `mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_sizes`
  to the system catalog. This table provides a mapping of logical sizes
  (e.g. `xlarge`) to the number of processes, as well as CPU and memory
  allocations for each process. To monitor the resource utilization for
  all extant cluster replicas as a % of the total allocation, you can now
  use:

  ```mzsql
  SELECT
    r.id AS replica_id,
    m.process_id,
    m.cpu_nano_cores / s.cpu_nano_cores * 100 AS cpu_percent,
    m.memory_bytes / s.memory_bytes * 100 AS memory_percent
  FROM mz_cluster_replicas AS r
  JOIN mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_sizes AS s ON r.size = s.size
  JOIN mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_metrics AS m ON m.replica_id = r.id;
  ```

  It's important to note that these tables are part of an unstable interface of
  Materialize (`mz_internal`), which means that their values may change at any
  time, and you should not rely on them for tasks like capacity planning for the
  time being.

* Add `mz_catalog.mz_aws_privatelink_connections` to the system catalog. This
  table contains a row for each [AWS PrivateLink connection](/sql/create-connection/#aws-privatelink)
  in the system, and allows you to retrieve the AWS principal that
  Materialize will use to connect to the VPC endpoint.

* Return an error rather than crashing if the value of the `AVRO KEY FULLNAME`
  or `AVRO VALUE FULLNAME` option in an Avro-formatted Kafka sink is not a
  valid Avro name {{% gh 16433 %}}.

* Return the current timestamp of the `EpochMillis` timeline when the `mz_now
  ()` function is used outside the context of a specific timeline, such as
  `SELECT mz_now();`. The old behavior was to return [`u64::MAX`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u64.html#associatedconstant.MAX).

## Patch releases

### v0.36.2

* Fix incorrect decoding of negative timestamps (i.e. prior to the Unix epoch:
  January 1st, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC) in Avro records {{% gh 16609 %}}.
