## v0.40.0

* Allow configuring an `AVAILABILITY ZONE` option for each broker when creating
  a Kafka connection using [AWS PrivateLink](/sql/create-connection/#kafka-per-broker-network-security):

  ```sql
  CREATE CONNECTION privatelink_svc TO AWS PRIVATELINK (
      SERVICE NAME 'com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0e123abc123198abc',
      AVAILABILITY ZONES ('use1-az1', 'use1-az4')
  );

  CREATE CONNECTION kafka_connection TO KAFKA (
      BROKERS (
          'broker1:9092' USING AWS PRIVATELINK privatelink_svc (AVAILABILITY ZONE 'use1-az1'),
          'broker2:9092' USING AWS PRIVATELINK privatelink_svc (
            AVAILABILITY ZONE 'use1-az4',
            PORT 9093
          )
      )
  );
  ```

  Specifying the correct availability zone for each broker allows Materialize to
  be more efficient with its network connections. Without the `AVAILABILITY
  ZONE` option, when Materialize initiates a connection to a Kafka broker, it
  must attempt to connect to each availability zone in sequence to determine
  which availability zone the broker is running in. With the `AVAILABILITY
  ZONE` option, Materialize can connect immediately to the correct availability
  zone.
