## v0.43.0

* Limit the size of SQL statements to **1MB**. Statements that exceed this limit
  will be rejected.

* Add the `bool_and` and `bool_or` [aggregate functions](/sql/functions/#aggregate-func),
  which compute whether a column contains all true values or at least one
  true value, respectively.

* Improve the output of `EXPLAIN [MATERIALIZED] VIEW $view_name` and `EXPLAIN
  PHYSICAL PLAN FOR [MATERIALIZED] VIEW $view_name` to print the name of the
  view. The output will now look similar to:

  ```sql
  EXPLAIN VIEW v;

      Optimized Plan
  ----------------------------------
   materialize.public.v:           +
     Filter (#0 = 1) AND (#3 = 3)  +
       Get materialize.public.data +
  ```

* Disallow `NATURAL JOIN` and `*` expressions in views that directly reference
  system objects. Instead, project the required columns and convert all
  `NATURAL JOIN`s to `USING` joins.

* Fix a bug where active [subscriptions](/sql/subscribe/) were not terminated when
  their underlying relations were dropped {{% gh 17476 %}}.
