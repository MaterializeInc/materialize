## v0.44.0

* Remove the `cpu_percent_normalized` column from the
  `mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_utilization` system catalog view. CPU
  utilization metrics will be restored in a future release.

* Add the `timing` option to `EXPLAIN`. Using this option annotates the output
  with the time spent in optimization (including decorrelation), which is
  useful to detect performance regressions in internal benchmarking.

* Add a `MAX CARDINALITY` parameter to the `COUNTER` load generator source. If
  specified, the counter load generator will begin retracting the oldest
  emitted value for each new value it emits, once it has crossed the max
  cardinality threshold. This is useful for internal load testing.
