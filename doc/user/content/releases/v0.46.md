## v0.46.0

#### SQL

* Add [`mz_internal.mz_subscriptions`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_subscriptions)
  to the system catalog. This table describes all active `SUBSCRIBE` operations
  in the system.

* Add support for new SQL functions:

  | Function                                        | Description                                                             |
  | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | [`uuid_generate_v5`](/sql/functions/#uuid-func) | Generates a UUID in the given namespace using the specified input name. |

* Add the `is_superuser` configuration parameter, which reports whether the
  current session is a _superuser_ with admin privileges. This is part of the
  work to enable **Role-based access control** (RBAC) in a future release {{% gh
  11579 %}}.

* Add the [`ALTER ROLE`](/sql/alter-role) command, as well as role attributes to
  the [`CREATE ROLE`](/sql/create-role/) command. This is part of the work to
  enable **Role-based access control** (RBAC){{% gh 11579 %}}.

  It's important to note that no role attributes or privileges will be
  considered when executing `CREATE ROLE` statements. These attributes will be
  saved and considered in a future release.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Fix a bug that would cause the `mz_sources` and `mz_sinks` system tables to
  report the wrong size for a source after an `ALTER {SOURCE|SINK} ... SET
  (SIZE = ...)` command.

## Patch releases

### v0.46.1

* Stabilizate resource utilization in the [`mz_introspection`](/sql/show-clusters/#mz_introspection-system-cluster)
  system cluster.
