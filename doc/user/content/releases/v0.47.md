## v0.47.0

#### SQL

* Add the [`GRANT ROLE`](/sql/grant-role) and [`REVOKE ROLE`](/sql/revoke-role)
  commands, which allow granting/revoking membership of one role to/from another
  role. This is part of the work to enable **Role-based access control** (RBAC)
  in a future release {{% gh 11579 %}}.

* Allow rejecting user queries based on role attributes. This privilege is
  exclusive to _superusers_. This is part of the work to enable **Role-based
  access control** (RBAC) in a future release {{% gh 11579 %}}.

* Add [`mz_internal.mz_dataflow_operator_parents`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_dataflow_operator_parents)
  to the system catalog. This view describes how operators are nested into
  scopes, by relating operators to their parent operators, which is useful for
  internal system observability.

* Add `dataflow_id` to the [`mz_compute_exports`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_compute_exports)
  introspection source. This introspection source describes the dataflows
  created by indexes, materialized views, and subscriptions in the system.
