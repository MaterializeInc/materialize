## v0.50.0

#### SQL

* Add [`mz_internal.mz_dataflow_arrangement_sizes`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_dataflow_arrangement_sizes)
  to the system catalog. This view describes how many records and batches are
  contained in operators under each dataflow, which is useful to approximate how
  much memory a dataflow is using.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Improve the usability of subscriptions when using the [`WITH (PROGRESS)`](/sql/subscribe/#progress)
  option. Progress information is now guaranteed to include a progress message
  as the **first** update, indicating the `AS OF` time of the subscription.
  This helps distinguish between an empty snapshot and an "in-flight" snapshot.

* Improve the reliability of SSH tunnel connections when used with large cluster
  sizes, and add more verbose logging to make it easier to debug SSH connection
  errors during source and sink creation.

* Mitigate connection interruptions and ingestion hiccups for all connection
  types. If you observe ingestion lag in your sources or sinks, please [get in touch](https://materialize.com/s/chat)!
