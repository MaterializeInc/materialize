## v0.51.0

#### Sources and sinks

* Add support for replicating tables from specific schemas in the
  [PostgreSQL source](/sql/create-source/postgres/), using the new `FOR SCHEMAS(...)`
  option:

  ```sql
  CREATE SOURCE mz_source
    FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION pg_connection (PUBLICATION 'mz_source')
    FOR SCHEMAS (public, finance)
    WITH (SIZE = '3xsmall');
  ```

  With this option, only tables that are part of the publication _and_
  namespaced with the specified schema(s) will be replicated.

#### SQL

* Add `disk_bytes` to the `mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_{metrics, sizes}`
  system catalog tables. This column is currently `NULL`. In the future, it
  will allow users to inspect disk utilization for each cluster replica.

* Add the `translate` [string function](/sql/functions/#string-func), which
  replaces a set of characters in a string with another set of characters
  (one by one, regardless of the order of those characters):

  ```sql
  SELECT translate('12345', '134', 'ax');

	 translate
	-----------
	 a2x5
  ```

* Add new configuration parameters:

  | Configuration parameter      | Scope    | Description                                                                             |
  | ---------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `enable_session_rbac_checks` | Session  | **Read-only.** Boolean flag indicating whether RBAC is enabled for the current session. |
  | `enable_rbac_checks`         | System   | Boolean flag indicating whether to apply RBAC checks before executing statements. Setting this variable requires _superuser_ privileges. |

  This is part of the work to enable **Role-based access control** (RBAC) in a
  future release {{% gh 11579 %}}.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Improve the reliability of SSH tunnel connections in the presence of short
  idle TCP connection timeouts.
