## v0.53.0

#### SQL

* Add support for table aliases in [joins](https://materialize.com/docs/transform-data/join/)
  that specify the `USING` clause. As an example, the column `c` used as the
  join condition in the statement below will be referenceable as `lhs.c`,
  `rhs.c`, and `joint.c`.

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM lhs
  JOIN rhs USING (c) AS joint;
  ```

* Require the `CREATECLUSTER` attribute when creating sources or sinks using the
  `SIZE` parameter, which results in the creation of a linked cluster (see
  [Materialize v0.39](../v0.39)). This is part of the work to enable **Role-based
  access control** (RBAC) {{% gh 11579 %}}.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Fix a bug that prevented the PostgreSQL source from replicating tables with
  identifiers that contained quotes (e.g. `"""table"""`) or needed to be
  quoted (e.g. `"select"`).

* This release restores compatibility with `dbt-materialize` <= v1.4.0, which
  broke in the previous release due to the changes in introspection routing
  (see [Materialize v0.52](../v0.52)).
