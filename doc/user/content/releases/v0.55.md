## v0.55.0

#### SQL

* Add `SET schema` and `SHOW schema` as aliases to `SET search_path` and `SELECT
  current_schema`, respectively. From this release, the following sequence of
  commands provide the same functionality:

  ```sql
  materialize=> SET schema = finance;
  SET
  materialize=> SHOW schema;
   schema
  ---------
   finance
  (1 row)
  ```

  ```sql
   materialize=> SET search_path = finance, public;
   SET
   materialize=> SELECT current_schema;
    current_schema
   ----------------
    finance
   (1 row)
  ```

* Improve and extend the base implementation of **Role-based
  access control** (RBAC):

  * Add support for the [`REASSIGN OWNED`](/sql/reassign-owned/) command, which
    allows reassigning the ownership of objects owned by one or more roles to a
    different role.

  It's important to note that role-based access control (RBAC) is **disabled by
  default**. You must [contact us](https://materialize.com/contact/) to enable
  this feature in your Materialize region.
