## v0.56.0

#### Sources and sinks

* Add a `MARKETING` [load generator source](/sql/create-source/load-generator/#marketing),
  which provides synthetic data to simulate Machine Learning scenarios.

#### SQL

* Improve and extend the base implementation of **Role-based
  access control** (RBAC):

  * Add the `has_table_privilege` access control function, which allows a role
    to query if it has privileges on a specific relation:

    ```sql
    SELECT has_table_privilege('marta','auction_house','select');

	 has_table_privilege
	---------------------
	 t
	(1 row)
    ```

  It's important to note that role-based access control (RBAC) is **disabled by
  default**. You must [contact us](https://materialize.com/contact/) to enable
  this feature in your Materialize region.
