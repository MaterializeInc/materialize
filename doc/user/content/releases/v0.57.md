## v0.57.0

#### SQL

* Improve and extend the base implementation of **Role-based
  access control** (RBAC):

  * Allow specifying multiple database objects in the [`GRANT PRIVILEGE`](/sql/grant-privilege)
    and [`REVOKE PRIVILEGE`](/sql/revoke-privilege) commands.

  It's important to note that role-based access control (RBAC) is **disabled by
  default**. You must [contact us](https://materialize.com/contact/) to enable
  this feature in your Materialize region.


* Add `RESET schema` as an alias to `RESET search_path`. From this release, the
  following sequence of commands provide the same functionality:

  ```sql
  materialize=> SET schema = finance;
  SET
  materialize=> SHOW schema;
   schema
  ---------
   finance
  (1 row)

  materialize=> RESET schema;
  RESET
  materialize=> SHOW schema;
   schema
  --------
   public
  (1 row)
  ```

  ```sql
   materialize=> SET search_path = finance, public;
   SET
   materialize=> SELECT current_schema;
    current_schema
   ----------------
    finance
   (1 row)

   materialize=> RESET schema;
   RESET
   materialize=> SELECT current_schema;
    current_schema
   ----------------
    public
   (1 row)
  ```

* Add support for new SQL functions:

  | Function                                        | Description                                                                                                 |
  | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | [`array_position`](/sql/functions/#array-func)  | Returns the subscript of the first occurrence of the second argument in the array. `NULL` if not found.     |
  | [`parse_ident`](/sql/functions/#string-func)    | Splits a qualified identifier into an array of identifiers, removing any quoting of individual identifiers. |

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* **Breaking change.** Change the `type` associated with progress subsources in
    the `mz_sources` system catalog table from `subsource` to `progress`. This
    change should have no user impact, but please [let us know](https://materialize.com/s/chat)
    if you run into any issues.

* **Breaking change.** Add `oid` and re-order the columns of the `mz_secrets`
    system catalog table. This change should have no user impact, but please
    [let us know](https://materialize.com/s/chat) if you run into any issues.

* Avoid panicking in the absence of the default `materialize` database {{% gh 19874 %}}.
