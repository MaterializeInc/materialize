## v0.58.0

#### SQL

* Add support for new SQL functions:

  | Function                                        | Description                                                                                                 |
  | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | [`datediff`](/sql/functions/datediff/)  | Returns the difference between two date, time or timestamp expressions based on the specified date or time part.     |
  | [`pg_cancel_backend`](/sql/functions/#generic-func)    | Cancels an in-progress query on the specified connection ID. Returns whether the connection ID existed. |

* Accept [scalar functions](/sql/functions/#functions) in the `FROM` clause of a query.

* Add support for the PostgreSQL `IS DISTINCT FROM` operator. This operator
  behaves like `<>`, except that it treats `NULL` like a normal value that
  compares equal to itself and not equal to all other values.

* Allow specifying a comma-separated list of schemas in the `DROP SCHEMA`.

* Add [`mz_internal.mz_object_transitive_dependencies`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_object_transitive_dependencies)
  to the system catalog. This table describes the transitive dependency structure between all database objects in the system.

* Improve and extend the base implementation of **Role-based
  access control** (RBAC):

  * Allow specifying multiple role names in the [`GRANT ROLE`](/sql/grant-role)
    and [`REVOKE ROLE`](/sql/revoke-role) commands.

  * Add the [`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`](/sql/alter-default-privileges/) command. which allows users to configure the default privileges for newly created objects.

  * Add the `has_system_privilege` function to query role's system privileges, which reports if a specified user has a system privilege.

  It's important to note that role-based access control (RBAC) is **disabled by
  default**. You must [contact us](https://materialize.com/contact/) to enable
  this feature in your Materialize region.
