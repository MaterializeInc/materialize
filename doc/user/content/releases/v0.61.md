## v0.61.0

[//]: # "NOTE(morsapaes) v0.61 includes a first version of webhook sources
released behind a feature flag."

#### SQL

* Improve and extend the base implementation of **Role-based
  access control** (RBAC):

  * Include `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`, and `ALTER OWNER`
    events in the [`mz_audit_events`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_catalog/#mz_audit_events)
    system catalog table.

  * Require connection and secret `USAGE` privileges to execute [`CREATE SINK`](/sql/create-sink/)
    commands.

  It's important to note that role-based access control (RBAC) is **disabled by
  default**. You must [contact us](https://materialize.com/contact/) to enable
  this feature in your Materialize region.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Do not require a valid active cluster to run specific types of queries, like
  `SELECT n` health checks {{% gh 20420 %}}. This fixes a known issue in the
  `dbt-materialize` adapter, where specific commands that run such queries as
  part of their execution (e.g. `dbt debug`) would fail in the absence of the
  pre-installed `default` cluster.

* Extend `pg_catalog` and `information_schema` system catalog coverage for
  compatibility with external tools like DBeaver and PopSQL {{% gh 20429 %}}
  {{% gh 20314 %}} {{% gh 20427 %}}.

* Avoid panicking in the presence of concurrent DDL and `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or
  `INSERT INTO` statements {{% gh 20420 %}}.
