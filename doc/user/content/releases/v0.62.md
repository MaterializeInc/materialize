## v0.62.0

#### Sources and sinks

* Support adding individual subsources in the [PostgreSQL source](/sql/create-source/postgres/)
  using the new `ALTER SOURCE...ADD SUBSOURCE` syntax.

#### SQL

* Add the [`try_parse_monotonic_iso8601_timestamp`](/sql/functions/pushdown/)
  function, which should be used in temporal filters involving `string` timestamps
  (e.g. extracted from `jsonb` columns) to benefit from [filter pushdown optimization](/transform-data/patterns/temporal-filters/#temporal-filter-pushdown).

  For a given JSON-formatted source, the following query cannot
  benefit from filter pushdown:

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM foo
  WHERE (data ->> 'timestamp')::timestamp > mz_now();
  ```

  But can be optimized as:

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM foo
  WHERE try_parse_monotonic_iso8601_timestamp(data ->> 'timestamp') > mz_now();
  ```

  It's important to note that temporal filter pushdown is **disabled by
  default**. You must [contact us](https://materialize.com/contact/) to enable
  this feature in your Materialize region.

* Improve and extend the base implementation of **Role-based
  access control** (RBAC):

  * Add the `pg_has_role` function, which reports if a specified `user` has
    `USAGE` or `MEMBER` privileges for a specified `role`.

  It's important to note that role-based access control (RBAC) is **disabled by
  default**. You must [contact us](https://materialize.com/contact/) to enable
  this feature in your Materialize region.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements
