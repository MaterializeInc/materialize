## v0.64.0

#### SQL

* Improve and extend the base implementation of **Role-based
  access control** (RBAC):

  * Require specifying a target role in the `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` command.
    Previously, the target role was optional and defaulted to the current role,
    which is seldom what users intend to achieve with this command.

  * Add the `has_role` function as an alias to `pg_has_role`. This function
    reports if a specified `user` has `USAGE` or `MEMBER` privileges for a
    specified `role`.

  It's important to note that role-based access control (RBAC) is **disabled by
  default**. You must [contact us](https://materialize.com/contact/) to enable
  this feature in your Materialize region.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Fix a bug that let users specify the `DETAILS` option when creating a
  [PostgreSQL source](/sql/create-source/postgres/) {{% gh 20944 %}}.

* Extend support for single DDL statements in explicit transactions to the
  `ALTER` and `DROP` commands. This improves the integration experience with
  external tools like [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) and [Hex](https://hex.tech/).
