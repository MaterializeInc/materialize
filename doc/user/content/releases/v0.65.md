## v0.65.0

#### SQL

* **Breaking change.** Limit the length of object identifiers to 255 bytes.

* Include the name and size of cluster replicas in the output of
  [`SHOW CLUSTERS`](/sql/show-clusters/) as a new column named `replicas`.

* Improve and extend the base implementation of **Role-based
  access control** (RBAC):

  * Add the [`SHOW ROLES`](/sql/show-roles/) command, which lists the roles
    available in the system.

  It's important to note that role-based access control (RBAC) is **disabled by
  default**. You must [contact us](https://materialize.com/contact/) to enable
  this feature in your Materialize region.

* Add [`mz_internal.mz_object_fully_qualified_names`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_object_fully_qualified_names)
  and [`mz_internal.mz_object_lifetimes`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_object_lifetimes)
  to the system catalog. These views enrich [`mz_objects`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_catalog/#mz_objects)
  with namespace and lifetime event information, respectively.

* Add [`mz_internal.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_expected_group_size_advice)
  to the system catalog. This view provides advice on opportunities to set the
  `EXPECTED GROUP SIZE` [query hint](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/select/#query-hints).

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* **Breaking change.** Disallow executing functions from the `mz_internal`
    schema {{% gh 20998 %}}. This change should have no user impact, but
    please [let us know](https://materialize.com/s/chat) if you run into any
    issues.
