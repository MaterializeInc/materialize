## v0.67.0

#### Sources and sinks

[//]: # "NOTE(morsapaes) This feature was released in v0.53 behind a feature
flag. The flag was raised in v0.67 for ENVELOPE UPSERT -— so mentioning it
here."

* Support upserts in the output of `SUBSCRIBE` via the new [`ENVELOPE UPSERT` clause](/sql/subscribe/#envelope-upsert).
  This clause allows you to specify a `KEY` that Materialize uses to interpret the
  rows as a series of inserts, updates and deletes within each distinct
  timestamp. The output rows will have the following structure:

  ```mzsql
   SUBSCRIBE mview ENVELOPE UPSERT (KEY (key));

   mz_timestamp | mz_state | key  | value
   -------------|----------|------|--------
   100          | upsert   | 1    | 2
   100          | upsert   | 2    | 4
  ```

#### SQL

* Add [`mz_internal.mz_compute_dependencies`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_compute_dependencies)
  to the system catalog. This table describes the dependency structure between
  each compute object (index, materialized view, or subscription) and the
  sources of its data.

* Improve the output of [`EXPLAIN { OPTIMIZED | PHYSICAL } PLAN FOR MATERIALIZED VIEW`](/sql/explain-plan/)
  to return the plan generated at object creation time, rather than the plan that
  would be generated if the object was created with the current catalog state.

* Add support for [`TABLE`](/sql/table) expressions, which retrieve all rows
  from the named SQL table.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Extend `pg_catalog` and `information_schema` system catalog coverage for
  compatibility with Power BI.

* Increase in precision for the `AVG`, `VAR_*`, and `STDDEV*` functions.
