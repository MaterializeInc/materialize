## v0.71.0

[//]: # "NOTE(morsapaes) v0.71 shipped setting configuration parameters for roles
behind a feature flag."

#### Sources and sinks

* Support using the new `NULL DEFAULTS` option in Avro-formatted [Kafka sinks](/sql/create-sink/).
When specified, this option will generate an Avro schema where every nullable
field has a default of `NULL`.

#### SQL

* Add the [`EXPLAIN CREATE { MATERIALIZED VIEW | INDEX }`](/sql/explain-plan/#explained-object)
syntax options, which allow exploring what plan Materialize would create if one
were to re-create the object with the current catalog state.
