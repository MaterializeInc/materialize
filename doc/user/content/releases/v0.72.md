## v0.72.0

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Refactor [`mz_internal.mz_dataflow_arrangement_sizes`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_dataflow_arrangement_sizes)
to include **all active dataflows**, not just the ones referenced from the
system catalog. This makes debugging issues like high memory usage caused by
arrangements more intuitive for users.
