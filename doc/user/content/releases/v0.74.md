## v0.74.0

[//]: # "NOTE(morsapaes) v0.74 shipped the ALTER SCHEMA...RENAME command behind
a feature flag. This work makes progress towards supporting blue/green
deployments."

#### SQL

* Bring back support for [window aggregations](/sql/functions/#window-functions), or
  aggregate functions (e.g., `sum`, `avg`) that use an `OVER` clause.

  ```mzsql
  CREATE TABLE sales(time int, amount int);

  INSERT INTO sales VALUES (1,3), (2,6), (3,1), (4,5), (5,5), (6,6);

  SELECT time, amount, SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY time) AS cumulative_amount
  FROM sales
  ORDER BY time;

   time | amount | cumulative_amount
  ------+--------+-------------------
      1 |      3 |                 3
      2 |      6 |                 9
      3 |      1 |                10
      4 |      5 |                15
      5 |      5 |                20
      6 |      6 |                26
  ```

  For an overview of window function support, check the [updated documentation](/transform-data/patterns/window-functions/).

* Add support for new `SHOW` commands related to [role-based access control](/manage/access-control/#role-based-access-control-rbac) (RBAC):

  | Command                                                    | Description                                          |
  | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
  | [`SHOW PRIVILEGES`](/sql/show-privileges/)                 | Lists the privileges granted on all objects.         |
  | [`SHOW ROLE MEMBERSHIP`](/sql/show-role-membership/)       | Lists the members of each role.                      |
  | [`SHOW DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`](/sql/show-default-privileges/) | Lists any default privileges granted on any objects. |

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Improve error message for possibly mistyped column names, suggesting similarly
  named columns if the one specified cannot be found.

  ```mzsql
  CREATE SOURCE case_sensitive_names
  FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION pg (
    PUBLICATION 'mz_source',
    TEXT COLUMNS [pk_table."F2"]
  )
  FOR TABLES (
    "enum_table"
  );
  contains: invalid TEXT COLUMNS option value: column "pk_table.F2" does not exist
  hint: The similarly named column "pk_table.f2" does exist.
  ```

* Fix a bug where `ASSERT NOT NULL` options on materialized views were not
  persisted across restarts of the environment.
