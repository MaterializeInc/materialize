## v0.75.0

[//]: # "NOTE(morsapaes) v0.75 shipped the ALTER [CLUSTER|SCHEMA]...SWAP command
behind a feature flag. This work makes progress towards supporting blue/green
deployments."

#### SQL

* Change the semantics and schema of the [`mz_internal.mz_frontiers`](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_frontiers)
  system catalog table, and add the [`mz_internal.mz_cluster_replica_frontiers`](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_cluster_replica_frontiers)
  system catalog table. These objects are mostly useful to support existing and
  upcoming features in Materialize.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Remove the requirement of `USAGE` privileges on types for `SELECT` and
  `EXPLAIN` statements.
