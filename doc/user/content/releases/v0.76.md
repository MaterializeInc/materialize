## v0.76.0

#### Sources and sinks

* Allow specifying a default SSH connection when creating a [Kafka connection over SSH](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-connection/#ssh-tunnel-t1)
  using the `SSH TUNNEL` top-level option. The default connection will be used
  to connect to any new or unlisted brokers.

  ```sql
  CREATE CONNECTION kafka_connection TO KAFKA (
      BROKER 'broker1:9092',
      SSH TUNNEL ssh_connection
  );
  ```

* Support previewing the Avro schema that will be generated for an
  Avro-formatted [Kafka sink](/sql/create-sink/kafka/) ahead of sink creation
  using the [`EXPLAIN { KEY | VALUE } SCHEMA`](/sql/explain-schema/) syntax.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Improve [connection validation](/sql/create-connection/#connection-validation)
  for Confluent Schema Registry connections. Materialize will now attempt to
  connect to the identified service, rather than only building the client during
  validation.
