## v0.78.0

#### Sources and sinks

* **Breaking change.** Use `SSL` as the default security protocol in Kafka
    connections when no `SSL...` or `SASL...` options are specified.
    Previously, `PLAINTEXT` was used as the default.

* Add support for the `PLAINTEXT` and `SASL_PLAINTEXT` security protocols for
  Kafka connections.

* Allow Kafka connections to enable the `SSL` security protocol without enabling
  TLS client authentication (i.e., using TLS only for encryption).

* Add the [`INCLUDE HEADER` option](/sql/create-source/kafka/#headers) to Kafka
sources, which allows extracting individual headers from Kafka messages and
expose them as columns of the source.

  ```sql
  CREATE SOURCE kafka_metadata
    FROM KAFKA CONNECTION kafka_connection (TOPIC 'data')
    FORMAT AVRO USING CONFLUENT SCHEMA REGISTRY CONNECTION csr_connection
    INCLUDE HEADER 'c_id' AS client_id, HEADER 'key' AS encryption_key BYTES,
    ENVELOPE NONE
  ```

  ```sql
  SELECT
      id,
      seller,
      item,
      client_id::numeric,
      encryption_key
  FROM kafka_metadata;

  id | seller |        item        | client_id |    encryption_key

#### SQL

* Add [`mz_timezone_names`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_catalog/#mz_timezone_names)
and [`mz_timezone_abbreviations`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_catalog/#mz_timezone_abbreviations)
to the system catalog. These views contains a row for each supported timezone
and each supported timezone abbreviation, respectively.
