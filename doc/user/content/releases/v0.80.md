## v0.80.0

[//]: # "NOTE(morsapaes) v0.80 shipped support for expressions in the LIMIT
clause and AWS connections behind a feature flag."

#### Sources and sinks

* **Breaking change.** Disallow specifying more starting offsets than the number
    of partitions for [Kafka sources](/sql/create-source/kafka/#setting-start-offsets).

* Allow configuring the group ID (`GROUP ID PREFIX`) for [Kafka sources](/sql/create-source/kafka/#connection-options),
  and the group ID and transactional ID (`TRANSACTIONAL ID PREFIX`, `PROGRESS GROUP ID PREFIX`)
  for [Kafka sinks](/sql/create-sink/kafka/#connection-options)).

#### SQL

* Add `statement_kind` to `mz_internal.mz_activity_log`.
This column provides the type of the logged statement, e.g. `select` for a
`SELECT` query, or `NULL` if the statement was empty.

* Add [mz_internal.mz_notices](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_notices) to
  the system catalog. This view contains a list of currently active notices
  emitted by the system, and requires `superuser` privileges for querying.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Allow bare references to tables, views, and sources whose name matches the
  name of a type.
