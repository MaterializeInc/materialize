## v0.81.0

[//]: # "NOTE(morsapaes) v0.81 shipped a stub implementation of the MySQL source
behind a feature flag."

#### SQL

* Allow _superusers_ to modify the default value for certain [configuration parameters](/sql/set/#other-configuration-parameters)
  globally (i.e. for all users) using the[`ALTER SYSTEM...SET`](/sql/alter-system-set/)
  command.

* Support user-configured data retention for materialized views and sources
  (excluding multi-output sources, i.e. PostgreSQL sources) via the new `RETAIN
  HISTORY` syntax. Support in multi-output sources will be added in a future
  release.

* Add [`mz_hydration_statuses`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_hydration_statuses)
  to the system catalog. This view describes the per-replica hydration status of
  each object powered by a dataflow.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Rename `mz_compute_hydration_status` to [`mz_compute_hydration_statuses`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_compute_hydration_statuses),
  for consistency with other objects in the system catalog.

* Fix a bug in which Avro-formatted Kafka sources could fail to decode records
  if the reader schema contained a field with a logical type of
  `timestamp-millis`, `timestamp-micros`, or `date` with a default value
  {{% gh 24094 %}}.
