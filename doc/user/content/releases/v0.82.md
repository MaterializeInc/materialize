## v0.82.0

[//]: # "NOTE(morsapaes) v0.82 shipped support for REFRESH options in
materialized views and statement lifecycle logging behind a feature flag."

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Rename the [pre-installed cluster](/sql/show-clusters/#pre-installed-clusters)
  from `default` to `quickstart` for **new** Materialize regions. In existing
  regions where the pre-installed cluster has not been renamed or dropped, this
  cluster retains the `default` name.
