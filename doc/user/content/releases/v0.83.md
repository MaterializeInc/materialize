## v0.83

#### Sources and sinks

* Improve status reporting for [PostgreSQL sources](/sql/create-source/postgres/)
  by ensuring definite errors (e.g. dropping a publication upstream) are exposed.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Prevent users from creating indexes on system catalog objects. If you're using
  these objects in a context that requires indexing, we recommend creating a
  view over the catalog objects, and indexing that view instead.

  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW mz_objects_indexed AS
  SELECT  o.id AS object_id,
          s.name AS schema_name
  FROM mz_objects o
  LEFT JOIN mz_schemas s ON o.schema_id = s.id;

  CREATE INDEX cara_tmp_i on mz_objects_indexed (object_id);
  ```

* Fix a bug that allowed users to configure clusters containing storage objects
  (i.e., sources, sinks) with more than one replica. This is an unsupported
  state, since such clusters can, at most, have `REPLICATION FACTOR = 1`.
