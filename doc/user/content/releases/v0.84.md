## v0.84

#### Sources and sinks

* **Breaking change.** Deprecate the `SIZE` option for sources and sinks, which
    transparently created a (linked) cluster to maintain the object. Use the
    `IN CLUSTER` clause to create a source or sink in a specific a cluster. If
    you omit the clause altogether, the object will be created in the active
    cluster for the session.

  **New syntax**

  ```mzsql
  --Create the object in a specific cluster
  CREATE SOURCE json_source
  IN CLUSTER some_cluster
  FROM KAFKA CONNECTION kafka_connection (TOPIC 'ch_anges')
  FORMAT JSON;

  --Create the object in the active cluster
  CREATE SOURCE json_source
  FROM KAFKA CONNECTION kafka_connection (TOPIC 'ch_anges')
  FORMAT JSON;
  ```

  **Deprecated syntax**

  ```mzsql
  --Create the object in a dedicated (linked) cluster
  CREATE SOURCE json_source
  FROM KAFKA CONNECTION kafka_connection (TOPIC 'ch_anges')
  FORMAT JSON
  WITH (SIZE = '3xsmall');
  ```

* Make timeouts (`transaction.timeout.ms`) configurable for
  [Kafka sinks](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-sink/). Default: 60000ms.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Fix query results that rely on static views with temporal filters {{% gh 24408 %}}.
