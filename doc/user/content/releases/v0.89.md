## v0.89

#### Sources and sinks

* Improve source and sink statistics reporting to no longer reset on restarts,
  and include the following new metrics in [`mz_internal.mz_source_statistics`](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_source_statistics):

  | Metric                                        | Description                                                             |
  | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `snapshot_records_known`                      | The size of the source's snapshot.                                      |
  | `snapshot_records_staged`                     | The amount of the source's snapshot Materialize has read.               |
  | `snapshot_committed`                          | Whether the initial snapshot for a source has been committed.           |
  | `offset_known`                                | The offset of the most recent data in the source's upstream service that Materialize knows about. |
  | `offset_committed`                            | The offset of the source's upstream service Materialize has fully committed.                      |

  These changes will be available in the Materialize console soon, so you can
  more easily monitor snapshot and ingestion progress for your sources.

#### SQL

* Remove the `mz_activity_log` system catalog view. These view was superseeded
by [`mz_recent_activity_log`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_recent_activity_log),
which contains a log of the SQL statements that have been issued to
Materialize in the past 3 days.

* Add [`mz_internal.mz_compute_operator_hydration_statuses`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_compute_operator_hydration_statuses)
to the system catalog. This table describes the dataflow operator hydration
status of compute objects (indexes or materialized views).

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Temporarily disallow `ALTER CONNECTION` commands on sources using the `UPSERT`
  envelope {{% gh 25418 %}}.
