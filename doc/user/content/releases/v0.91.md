## v0.91

[//]: # "NOTE(morsapaes) v0.91 shipped support for EXPLAIN FILTER PUSHDOWN
behind a feature flag."

#### Sources and sinks

* **Private preview.** Add a new [MySQL source](/sql/create-source/mysql/),
  which allows propagating change data from MySQL (5.7+) databases in real-time
  using [GTID-based binlog replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-gtids.html).

  **Syntax**

  ```mzsql
  CREATE SECRET mysqlpass AS '<MYSQL_PASSWORD>';

  CREATE CONNECTION mysql_connection TO MYSQL (
      HOST 'instance.foo000.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com',
      PORT 3306,
      USER 'materialize',
      PASSWORD SECRET mysqlpass
  );

  CREATE SOURCE mz_source
    FROM MYSQL CONNECTION mysql_connection
    FOR ALL TABLES;
  ```

    This source is compatible with MySQL managed services like
    [Amazon RDS for MySQL](/ingest-data/mysql/amazon-rds/),
    [Amazon Aurora MySQL](/ingest-data/mysql/amazon-aurora/),
    [Azure DB for MySQL](/ingest-data/mysql/azure-db/),
    and [Google Cloud SQL for MySQL](/ingest-data/mysql/google-cloud-sql/).

#### SQL

* Emit a notice if the `cluster` specified in the connection string used to
  connect to Materialize does not exist and the specified role does not have a
  default `cluster` set.

  ```bash
  NOTICE:  default cluster "quickstart" does not exist
  HINT:  Set a default cluster for the current role with ALTER ROLE <role> SET cluster TO <cluster>.
  psql (15.5 (Homebrew), server 9.5.0)
  Type "help" for help.

  materialize=>
  ```

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Bump the `max_connections` connection limit to `5000`, and enforce it for all
  users (including _superusers_).

* Correctly initialize source statistics in `mz_internal.mz_sources_statistics`
  when subsources are dropped and recreated using the `ALTER SOURCE...{ ADD |
  DROP } SUBSOURCE` command.
