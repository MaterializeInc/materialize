## v0.93

#### Sources and sinks

* Do not error if the `oid` or `typmod` of a column changes when using the `TEXT COLUMNS`
  option to ingest data as text in a [PostgreSQL source](/sql/create-source/postgres/).
  As an example, this allows evolving the structure of `enum` columns by using
  `ALTER TABLE <table> ALTER COLUMN <enum column> TYPE...`, which would
  previously have set the affected subsource into an errored state.

#### Bug fixes and other improvements

* Extend `pg_catalog` coverage with support for the [`obj_description()`](/sql/functions/#obj_description)
  and [`col_description`](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/functions/#col_description) functions.
