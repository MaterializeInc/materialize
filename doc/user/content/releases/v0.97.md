## v0.97

#### Sources and sinks

* Optimize memory usage of large transaction processing in the [PostgreSQL](/sql/create-source/postgres/)
  and [MySQL](/sql/create-source/mysql/) sources.

#### SQL

* Add the [`initcap` function](/sql/functions/#initcap), which returns a given
  string with the first character of every word in upper case and all other
  characters in lower case.

  ```mzsql
  SELECT initcap('bye DrivEr');

    initcap
   ---------------------
    Bye Driver
   (1 row)
  ```

* Add [`mz_materialized_view_refresh_strategies`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_materialized_view_refresh_strategies)
  and [`mz_cluster_schedules`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_cluster_schedules)
  to the system catalog. These tables were added in support of ongoing feature
  development.
