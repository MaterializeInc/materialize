Materialize releases new Self-Managed versions per the schedule outlined in [Release schedule](/releases/schedule/#self-managed-release-schedule).

## General rules for upgrading

## Upgrading the Helm Chart and Materialize Operator

{{< important >}}

When upgrading Materialize, always upgrade the Helm Chart and Materialize
Operator first.

{{</ important >}}

### Update the Helm Chart repository

To update your Materialize Helm Chart repository:

```shell
helm repo update materialize
```

View the available chart versions:

```shell
helm search repo materialize/materialize-operator --versions
```

### Upgrade your Materialize Operator

The Materialize Kubernetes Operator is deployed via Helm and can be updated
through standard `helm upgrade` command:

{{% include-syntax file="self_managed/upgrades"
example="syntax-helm-upgrade-operator" %}}

You can use `helm list` to find your release name. For example, if your Operator
is running in the namespace `materialize`, run `helm list`:

```shell
helm list -n materialize
```

Retrieve the name associated with the `materialize-operator` **CHART**; for
example, `my-demo` in the following helm list:

```none
NAME    	  NAMESPACE  	REVISION	UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART                                          APP VERSION
my-demo	materialize	1      2025-12-08 11:39:50.185976 -0500 EST	deployed	materialize-operator-v26.1.0    v26.1.0
```

Then, to upgrade:

```shell
helm upgrade -n materialize my-demo materialize/misc/helm-charts/operator \
  -f my-values.yaml \
  --version {{< self-managed/versions/get-latest-version >}}
```

## Upgrading Materialize Instances

**After** you have upgraded your Materialize Operator, upgrade your Materialize
instance(s) to the **APP Version** of the Operator. To find the version of your
currently deployed Materialize Operator:

```shell
helm list -n materialize
```

You will use the returned **App Version** for the updated `environmentdImageRef`
value. Specifically, for your Materialize instance(s), set
`environmentdImageRef` value to use the new version:

```
spec:
  environmentdImageRef: docker.io/materialize/environmentd:<app_version>
```


To minimize unexpected downtime and avoid connection drops at critical
periods for your application, the upgrade process involves two steps:

- First, stage the changes (update the `environmentdImageRef` with the new
  version) to the Materialize custom resource. The Operator watches for changes
  but does not automatically roll out the changes.

- Second, roll out the changes by specifying a new UUID for `requestRollout`.


### Stage the Materialize instance version change

To stage the Materialize instances version upgrade, update the
`environmentdImageRef` field in the Materialize custom resource spec to the
compatible version of your currently deployed Materialize Operator.

To stage, but **not** rollout, the Materialize instance version upgrade, you can
use the `kubectl patch` command; for example, if the **App Version** is {{< self-managed/versions/get-latest-version >}}:

```shell
kubectl patch materialize <instance-name> \
  -n <materialize-instance-namespace> \
  --type='merge' \
  -p "{\"spec\": {\"environmentdImageRef\": \"materialize/environmentd:{{< self-managed/versions/get-latest-version >}}\"}}"
```

{{< note >}}
Until you specify a new `requestRollout`, the Operator watches for updates but
does not roll out the changes.
{{< /note >}}


### Applying the changes via `requestRollout`

To apply chang Materialize instance upgrade, you must update the `requestRollout` field in the Materialize custom resource spec to a new UUID.
Be sure to consult the [Rollout Configurations](#rollout-configuration) to ensure you've selected the correct rollout behavior.
```shell
# Then trigger the rollout with a new UUID
kubectl patch materialize <instance-name> \
  -n <materialize-instance-namespace> \
  --type='merge' \
  -p "{\"spec\": {\"requestRollout\": \"$(uuidgen)\"}}"
```

It is possible to combine both operations in a single command if preferred:

```shell
kubectl patch materialize <instance-name> \
  -n materialize-environment \
  --type='merge' \
  -p "{\"spec\": {\"environmentdImageRef\": \"materialize/environmentd:{{< self-managed/versions/get-latest-version >}}\", \"requestRollout\": \"$(uuidgen)\"}}"
```

### Using YAML Definition

Alternatively, you can update your Materialize custom resource definition directly:

```yaml
apiVersion: materialize.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: Materialize
metadata:
  name: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
  namespace: materialize-environment
spec:
  environmentdImageRef: materialize/environmentd:{{< self-managed/versions/get-latest-version >}} # Update version as needed
  requestRollout: 22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222    # Use a new UUID
  forceRollout: 33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333      # Optional: for forced rollouts
  inPlaceRollout: false                                   # In Place rollout is deprecated and ignored. Please use rolloutStrategy
  rolloutStrategy: WaitUntilReady                         # The mechanism to use when rolling out the new version. Can be WaitUntilReady or ImmediatelyPromoteCausingDowntime
  backendSecretName: materialize-backend
```

Apply the updated definition:

```shell
kubectl apply -f materialize.yaml
```

## Rollout Configuration

### Forced Rollouts

If you need to force a rollout even when there are no changes to the instance:

```shell
kubectl patch materialize <instance-name> \
  -n materialize-environment \
  --type='merge' \
  -p "{\"spec\": {\"requestRollout\": \"$(uuidgen)\", \"forceRollout\": \"$(uuidgen)\"}}"
```

### Rollout strategies

The behavior of the new version rollout follows your `rolloutStrategy` setting:

| `rolloutStrategy` | Description                        |
| ----------------- | -----------------------------------|
| `WaitUntilReady`  | *Default*. New instances are created and all dataflows are determined to be ready before cutover and terminating the old version, temporarily requiring twice the resources during the transition. |
| `ImmediatelyPromoteCausingDowntime`| Tears down the prior version before creating and promoting the new version. This causes downtime equal to the duration it takes for dataflows to hydrate, but does not require additional resources. |
| `inPlaceRollout`| *Deprecated*.  The setting is ignored. |

## Verifying the Upgrade

After initiating the rollout, you can monitor the status field of the Materialize custom resource to check on the upgrade.

```shell
# Watch the status of your Materialize environment
kubectl get materialize -n materialize-environment -w

# Check the logs of the operator
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=materialize-operator -n materialize
```

## Upgrade guides
