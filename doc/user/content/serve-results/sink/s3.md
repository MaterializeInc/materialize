This guide walks you through the steps required to export results from
Materialize to Amazon S3. Copying results to S3 is
useful to perform tasks like periodic backups for auditing, or downstream
processing in analytical data warehouses like [Snowflake](/serve-results/snowflake/),
Databricks or BigQuery.

## Before you begin

- Ensure you have access to an AWS account, and permissions to create and manage
  IAM policies and roles. If you're not an account administrator, you will need
  support from one!

## Step 1. Set up an Amazon S3 bucket

First, you must set up an S3 bucket and give Materialize enough permissions to
write files to it. We **strongly** recommend using [role assumption-based authentication](/sql/create-connection/#aws-permissions)
to manage access to the target bucket.

### Create a bucket

1. Log in to your AWS account.

1. Navigate to **AWS Services**, then **S3**.

1. Create a new, general purpose S3 bucket with the suggested default
   configurations.

### Create an IAM policy

Once you create an S3 bucket, you must associate it with an [IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html)
that specifies what actions can be performed on the bucket by the Materialize
exporter role. For Materialize to be able to write data into the bucket, the
IAM policy must allow the following actions:

Action type  | Action name                                                                            | Action description
-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------
Write        | [`s3:PutObject`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)      | Grants permission to add an object to a bucket.
List         | [`s3:ListBucket`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html) | Grants permission to list some or all of the objects in a bucket.
Write        | [`s3:DeleteObject`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObject.html)| Grants permission to remove an object from a bucket.

To create a new IAM policy:

1. Navigate to **AWS Services**, then **AWS IAM**.

1. In the **IAM Dashboard**, click **Policies**, then **Create policy**.

1. For **Policy editor**, choose **JSON**.

1. Copy and paste the policy below into the editor, replacing `<bucket>` with
   the bucket name and `<prefix>` with the folder path prefix.

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                 "s3:PutObject",
                 "s3:DeleteObject"
               ],
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/<prefix>/*"
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:ListBucket"
               ],
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>",
               "Condition": {
                   "StringLike": {
                       "s3:prefix": [
                           "<prefix>/*"
                       ]
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. Click **Next**.

1. Enter a name for the policy, and click **Create policy**.

### Create an IAM role

Next, you must attach the policy you just created to a Materialize-specific
[IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html).

1. Navigate to **AWS Services**, then **AWS IAM**.

1. In the **IAM Dashboard**, click **Roles**, then **Create role**.

1. In **Trusted entity type**, select **Custom trust policy**, and copy and
   paste the policy below.

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::664411391173:role/MaterializeConnection"
               },
               "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
               "Condition": {
                   "StringEquals": {
                       "sts:ExternalId": "PENDING"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   Materialize **always uses the provided IAM principal** to assume the role, and
   also generates an **external ID** which uniquely identifies your AWS connection
   across all Materialize regions (see [AWS connection permissions](/sql/create-connection/#aws-permissions)).
   For now, you'll set this ID to a dummy value; later, you'll update it with
   the unique identifier for your Materialize region.

1. Click **Next**.

1. In **Add permissions**, select the IAM policy you created in [Create an IAM policy](#create-an-iam-policy),
   and click **Next**.

1. Enter a name for the role, and click **Create role**.

1. Click **View role** to see the role summary page, and note down the
   role **ARN**. You will need it in the next step to create an AWS connection in
   Materialize.

## Step 2. Create a connection

1. In the [SQL Shell](https://console.materialize.com/), or your preferred SQL
   client connected to Materialize, create an [AWS connection](/sql/create-connection/#aws),
   replacing `<account-id>` with the 12-digit number that identifies your
   AWS account, and  `<role>` with the name of the role you created in the
   previous step:

   ```mzsql
   CREATE CONNECTION aws_connection
      TO AWS (ASSUME ROLE ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<role>');
   ```

1. Retrieve the external ID for the connection:

   ```mzsql
   SELECT awsc.id, external_id
    FROM mz_internal.mz_aws_connections awsc
    JOIN mz_connections c ON awsc.id = c.id
    WHERE c.name = 'aws_connection';
   ```

   The external ID will have the following format:

   ```text
   mz_XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX_uXXX
   ```

1. In your AWS account, find the IAM role you created in [Create an IAM role](#create-an-iam-role)
   and, under **Trust relationships**, click **Edit trust policy**. Use the
   `external_id` from the previous step to update the trust policy's
   `sts:ExternalId`, then click **Update policy**.

   {{< warning >}}
   Failing to constrain the external ID in your role trust policy
   will allow other Materialize customers to assume your role and use AWS
   privileges you have granted the role!
   {{< /warning >}}

1. Back in Materialize, validate the AWS connection you created using the
   [`VALIDATE CONNECTION`](/sql/validate-connection) command.

   ```mzsql
   VALIDATE CONNECTION aws_connection;
   ```

   If no validation error is returned, you're ready to use this connection to
   run a bulk export from Materialize to your target S3 bucket! 🔥

## Step 3. Run a bulk export

To export data to your target S3 bucket, use the [`COPY TO`](/sql/copy-to/#copy-to-s3)
command, and the AWS connection you created in the previous step.

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab "Parquet">}}

```mzsql
COPY some_object TO 's3://<bucket>/<path>'
WITH (
    AWS CONNECTION = aws_connection,
    FORMAT = 'parquet'
  );
```

For details on the Parquet writer settings Materialize uses, as well as data
type support and conversion, check the [reference documentation](/sql/copy-to/#copy-to-s3-parquet).

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "CSV">}}

```mzsql
COPY some_object TO 's3://<bucket>/<path>'
WITH (
    AWS CONNECTION = aws_connection,
    FORMAT = 'csv'
  );
```

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

You might notice that Materialize first writes a sentinel file to the target S3
bucket. When the copy operation is complete, this file is deleted. This allows
using the [`s3:ObjectRemoved` event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/notification-how-to-event-types-and-destinations.html#supported-notification-event-types)
to trigger downstream processing.

## Step 4. (Optional) Add scheduling

Bulk exports to Amazon S3 using the `COPY TO` command are _one-shot_: every time
you want to export results, you must run the command. To automate running bulk
exports on a regular basis, you can set up scheduling, for example using a
simple `cron`-like service or an orchestration platform like Airflow or
Dagster.
