We want Materialize to be easy to use, so we designed it to work with SQL. However, every database implements SQL a little differently, and none matches the full standard. In general, we model our implementation after PostgreSQL.

This section is a reference that details the SQL commands and features we support.

## Architecture

- [Data types](./types)
- [Functions + operators](./functions)
- [Identifiers](./identifiers)
- [Namespaces](./namespaces)
- [System catalog](./system-catalog)
- [Timelines](./timelines)
