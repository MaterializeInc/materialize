`ALTER INDEX` changes the parameters of an index.

## Syntax

{{< diagram "alter-index.svg" >}}

Field | Use
------|-----
_name_ | The identifier of the index you want to alter.
**ENABLED** | [Enable](#enabling-indexes) the index, which lets Materialize use it again after being [disabled](/cli/#disable-user-indexes).
_field_ | The name of the option you want to alter.
_val_ | The new value for the option.

### `SET`/`RESET` options

The following option is valid within the `SET` and `RESET` clauses:

{{% index-with-options %}}

## Details

### Enabling indexes

After booting Materialize in
[`--disable-user-indexes`](/cli/#disable-user-indexes) mode, you can enable
individual indexes. This lets Materialize use the index again, which:

- Restarts the dataflow associated with the index, which can in turn e.g. start
  ingesting data from sources or sending data to sinks
- Allows inserting into tables

#### Tables

Note that when enabling indexes on tables, the first index you enable must be
the table's primary index, which was created at the same time as the table
itself. Only after enabling the primary index can you enable any secondary
indexes.

## Examples

To adjust the logical compaction window for the index named `some_primary_idx`:

```sql
ALTER INDEX some_primary_idx SET (logical_compaction_window = '500ms');
```

To reset the logical compaction window to its default value:

```sql
ALTER INDEX some_primary_idx RESET (logical_compaction_window);
```
