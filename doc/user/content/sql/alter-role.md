`ALTER ROLE` alters the attributes of an existing role.

{{< warning >}}
Role-based access control (RBAC) is under development {{% gh 11579 %}}.
Currently, no role attributes or privileges are considered when executing
`CREATE ROLE` statements, but these attributes are saved and will be considered
in a future release.

## Details

Unlike PostgreSQL, materialize derives the `LOGIN` and `SUPERUSER`
attributes for a role during authentication, every time that role tries
to connect to Materialize. Therefore, you cannot specify either
attribute when creating a new role. Additionally, we do not support
`CREATE USER` because it implies a `LOGIN` attribute for the role.

Unlike PostgreSQL, materialize does not currently support `NOINHERIT`.

You may not specify redundant or conflicting sets of options. For example,
Materialize will reject the statement `CREATE ROLE ... CREATEDB NOCREATEDB` because
the `CREATEDB` and `NOCREATEDB` options conflict.

## Examples

```sql
ALTER ROLE rj CREATEDB NOCREATECLUSTER;
```
```sql
SELECT name, create_db, create_cluster FROM mz_roles WHERE name = 'rj';
```
```nofmt
rj  true  false
```
