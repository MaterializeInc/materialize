`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` defines a view that is persisted in durable storage and
incrementally updated as new data arrives.

A materialized view specifies a [cluster](/overview/key-concepts/#clusters) that
is tasked with keeping its results up-to-date, but **can be referenced in
any cluster**. This allows you to effectively decouple the computational
resources used for view maintenance from the resources used for query serving.

## Syntax

{{< diagram "create-materialized-view.svg" >}}

Field | Use
------|-----
**OR REPLACE** | If a materialized view exists with the same name, replace it with the view defined in this statement. You cannot replace views that other views or sinks depend on, nor can you replace a non-view object with a view.
**IF NOT EXISTS** | If specified, _do not_ generate an error if a materialized view of the same name already exists. <br/><br/>If _not_ specified, throw an error if a view of the same name already exists. _(Default)_
_view&lowbar;name_ | A name for the materialized view.
**(** _col_ident_... **)** | Rename the `SELECT` statement's columns to the list of identifiers, both of which must be the same length. Note that this is required for statements that return multiple columns with the same identifier.
_cluster&lowbar;name_ | The cluster to maintain this materialized view. If not specified, defaults to the active cluster.
_select&lowbar;stmt_ | The [`SELECT` statement](../select) whose results you want to maintain incrementally updated.

## Details

### Usage patterns

Maintaining a materialized view in durable storage has resource and latency
costs that should be carefully considered depending on the main usage of the
view. It's a good idea to create a materialized view if:

* The results need to be available across clusters;
* View maintenance and query serving would benefit from being scaled
  independently;
* The final consumer of the view is a sink or a [subscription](../tail).

On the other hand, if you only need to access a view from a single cluster, you
should consider creating a [non-materialized view](../create-view) and building
an index on it instead. The index will incrementally maintain the results of
the view updated in memory within that cluster, allowing you to avoid the costs
and latency overhead of materialization.

exist."

### Indexes

Although you can query a materialized view directly, these queries will be
issued against Materialize's storage layer. This is expected to be fast, but
still slower than reading from memory. To improve the speed of queries on
materialized views, we recommend creating [indexes](../create-index) based on
common query patterns.

It's important to keep in mind that indexes are **local** to a cluster, and
maintained in memory. As an example, if you create a materialized view and
build an index on it in the `default` cluster, querying the view from a
different cluster will _not_ use the index; you should create the appropriate
indexes in each cluster you are referencing the materialized view in.

this exists+add detail about using indexes to optimize materialized view
stacking."

## Examples

### Creating a materialized view

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW winning_bids AS
SELECT auction_id,
       bid_id,
       item,
       amount
FROM highest_bid_per_auction
WHERE extract(epoch FROM end_time) * 1000 < mz_logical_timestamp();
```

[//]: # "TODO(morsapaes) Add more elaborate examples with \timing that show
things like querying materialized views from different clusters, indexed vs.
non-indexed, and so on."
