This document details how to connect Materialize to an Avro-formatted Kafka
topic.

## Examples

### Using a Confluent schema registry

```sql
CREATE SOURCE events
FROM KAFKA BROKER 'localhost:9092' TOPIC 'events'
FORMAT AVRO USING CONFLUENT SCHEMA REGISTRY 'http://localhost:8081';
```

This creates a source that...

- Automatically determines its schema from the Confluent Schema Registry.
- Decodes data received from the `events` topic published by Kafka running on
  `localhost:9092`.
- Decodes using an Avro schema.
- Is eligible to use the Debezium envelope because it's Avro-encoded and
  published by Kafka; however, this still depends on whether or not the upstream
  database publishes its data from a Debezium-enabled database.

### Inlining the Avro schema

```sql
CREATE SOURCE user
FROM KAFKA BROKER 'localhost:9092' TOPIC 'user'
FORMAT AVRO USING SCHEMA '{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "envelope",
  "fields": [
    ...
  ],
}'
ENVELOPE DEBEZIUM;
```

This creates a source that...

- Has its schema defined inline, and decodes data using that schema.
- Decodes data received from the `user` topic published by Kafka running on
  `localhost:9092`.
- Uses the Debezium envelope, meaning it supports delete, updates, and inserts.

### Upsert on a Kafka topic with string keys and Avro values

```sql
CREATE SOURCE current_predictions
FROM KAFKA BROKER 'localhost:9092' TOPIC 'current_predictions'
FORMAT AVRO USING SCHEMA FILE '/scratch/current_predictions.json'
ENVELOPE UPSERT;
```

This creates a source that...

- Has its schema in a file on disk, and decodes both messages and payload data using that schema.
- Decodes data received from the `current_predictions` topic published by Kafka running on
  `localhost:9092`.
- Uses message keys to determine what should be inserted, deleted, and updated.

### Connecting to a Kafka broker using SSL authentication

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED SOURCE data_v1
FROM KAFKA BROKER 'localhost:9092' TOPIC 'top-secret' WITH (
    security_protocol = 'SSL',
    ssl_key_location = '/secrets/materialized.key',
    ssl_certificate_location = '/secrets/materialized.crt',
    ssl_ca_location = '/secrets/ca.crt',
    ssl_key_password = 'mzmzmz'
)
FORMAT AVRO USING CONFLUENT SCHEMA REGISTRY 'https://localhost:8081';
```

This creates a source that...

- Connects to a Kafka broker and a Confluent Schema Registry that require SSL
  authentication, and whose certificates were both signed by the same CA
  certificate.
- Automatically determines its schema from the Confluent Schema Registry.
- Decodes data received from the `top-secret` topic published by Kafka running on
  `localhost:9092`.
- Is append-only.


### Connecting to a Kafka broker using Kerberos

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED SOURCE data_v1
FROM KAFKA BROKER 'broker.tld:9092' TOPIC 'tps-reports' WITH (
    security_protocol = 'sasl_plaintext',
    sasl_kerberos_keytab = '/secrets/materialized.keytab',
    sasl_kerberos_service_name = 'kafka',
    sasl_kerberos_principal = 'materialized@CI.MATERIALIZE.IO'
)
FORMAT AVRO USING SCHEMA FILE '/tps-reports-schema.json'
```

This creates a source that...

- Connects to a Kerberized Kafka broker whose service principal name is
  `kafka/broker.tld@CI.MATERIALIZE.IO`.
- Has its schema in a file on disk, and decodes payload data using that schema.
- Decodes data received from the `top-secret` topic published by Kafka running on
  `broker.tld:9092`.
- Is append-only.
