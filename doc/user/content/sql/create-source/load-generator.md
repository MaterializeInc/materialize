#### `load_generator_option`

{{< diagram "load-generator-option.svg" >}}

Field | Use
------|-----
_src_name_  | The name for the source.
**COUNTER** | Use the [counter](#counter) load generator.
**AUCTION** | Use the [auction](#auction) load generator.
**TPCH**    | Use the [tpch](#tpch) load generator.
**IF NOT EXISTS**  | Do nothing (except issuing a notice) if a source with the same name already exists.
**TICK INTERVAL**  | The interval at which the next datum should be emitted. Defaults to one second.
**SCALE FACTOR**   | The scale factor for the `TPCH` generator. Defaults to `0.01` (~ 10MB).

### `WITH` options

Field                                | Value     | Description
-------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------
`SIZE`                               | `text`    | **Required.** The [size](../#sizing-a-source) for the source. Accepts values: `3xsmall`, `2xsmall`, `xsmall`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `xlarge`.

## Description

Materialize has several built-in load generators, which provide a quick way to
get up and running with no external dependencies before plugging in your own
data sources. If you would like to see an additional load generator, please
submit a [feature request].

### Counter

The counter load generator produces the sequence `1`, `2`, `3`, â€¦. Each tick
interval, the next number in the sequence is emitted.

### Auction

The auction load generator simulates an auction house, where users are bidding
on an ongoing series of auctions. The auction source will be automatically demuxed
into multiple subsources when the `CREATE SOURCE` command is executed. This will
create the following subsources:

  * `organizations` describes the organizations known to the auction
    house.

    Field | Type       | Describes
    ------|------------|----------
    id    | [`bigint`] | A unique identifier for the organization.
    name  | [`text`]   | The organization's name.

  * `users` describes the users that belong to each organization.

    Field     | Type       | Describes
    ----------|------------|----------
    `id`      | [`bigint`] | A unique identifier for the user.
    `org_id`  | [`bigint`] | The identifier of the organization to which the user belongs. References `organizations.id`.
    `name`    | [`text`]   | The user's name.

  * `accounts` describes the account associated with each organization.

    Field     | Type       | Describes
    ----------|------------|----------
    `id`      | [`bigint`] | A unique identifier for the account.
    `org_id`  | [`bigint`] | The identifier of the organization to which the account belongs. References `organizations.id`.
    `balance` | [`bigint`] | The balance of the account in dollars.

  * `auctions` describes all past and ongoing auctions.

    Field      | Type                         | Describes
    -----------|------------------------------|----------
    `id`       | [`bigint`]                   | A unique identifier for the auction.
    `seller`   | [`bigint`]                   | The identifier of the user selling the item. References `users.id`.
    `item`     | [`text`]                     | The name of the item being sold.
    `end_time` | [`timestamp with time zone`] | The time at which the auction closes.

  * `bids` describes the bids placed in each auction.

    Field        | Type                         | Describes
    -------------|------------------------------|----------
    `id`         | [`bigint`]                   | A unique identifier for the bid.
    `buyer`      | [`bigint`]                   | The identifier vof the user placing the bid. References `users.id`.
    `auction_id` | [`text`]                     | The identifier of the auction in which the bid is placed. References `auctions.id`.
    `amount`     | [`bigint`]                   | The bid amount in dollars.
    `bid_time`   | [`timestamp with time zone`] | The time at which the bid was placed.

The organizations, users, and accounts are fixed at the time the source
is created. Each tick interval, either a new auction is started, or a new bid
is placed in the currently ongoing auction.

### TPCH

The TPCH load generator implements the [TPC-H benchmark specification](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/default5.asp).
The TPCH source must be used with `FOR ALL TABLES`, which will create the standard TPCH relations.
If `TICK INTERVAL` is specified, after the initial data load, an order and its lineitems will be changed at this interval.
If not specified, the dataset will not change over time.

## Examples

### Creating a counter load generator

To create a load generator source that emits the next number in the sequence every
second:

```sql
CREATE SOURCE counter
  FROM LOAD GENERATOR COUNTER
  WITH (SIZE = '3xsmall');
```

To examine the counter:

```sql
SELECT * FROM counter;
```
```nofmt
 counter
---------
       1
       2
       3
```

### Creating an auction load generator

To create the load generator source and its associated subsources:

```sql
CREATE SOURCE auction_house
  FROM LOAD GENERATOR AUCTION
  FOR ALL TABLES
  WITH (SIZE = '3xsmall');
```

To display the created subsources:

```sql
SHOW SOURCES;
```
```nofmt
     name      |      type      |  size
---------------+----------------+---------
 accounts      | subsource      |
 auction_house | load-generator | 3xsmall
 auctions      | subsource      |
 bids          | subsource      |
 organizations | subsource      |
 users         | subsource      |
```

To examine the simulated bids:

```sql
SELECT * from bids;
```
```nofmt
 id | buyer | auction_id | amount |          bid_time
----+-------+------------+--------+----------------------------
 10 |  3844 |          1 |     59 | 2022-09-16 23:24:07.332+00
 11 |  1861 |          1 |     40 | 2022-09-16 23:24:08.332+00
 12 |  3338 |          1 |     97 | 2022-09-16 23:24:09.332+00
```

### Creating a TPCH load generator

To create the load generator source and its associated subsources:

```sql
CREATE SOURCE tpch
  FROM LOAD GENERATOR TPCH (SCALE FACTOR 1)
  FOR ALL TABLES
  WITH (SIZE = '3xsmall');
```

To display the created subsources:

```sql
SHOW SOURCES;
```
```nofmt
   name   |      type      |  size
----------+----------------+---------
 tpch     | load-generator | 3xsmall
 supplier | subsource      |
 region   | subsource      |
 partsupp | subsource      |
 part     | subsource      |
 orders   | subsource      |
 nation   | subsource      |
 lineitem | subsource      |
 customer | subsource      |
```

To run the Pricing Summary Report Query (Q1), which reports the amount of
billed, shipped, and returned items:

```sql
SELECT
    l_returnflag,
    l_linestatus,
    sum(l_quantity) AS sum_qty,
    sum(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price,
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price,
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge,
    avg(l_quantity) AS avg_qty,
    avg(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price,
    avg(l_discount) AS avg_disc,
    count(*) AS count_order
FROM
    lineitem
WHERE
    l_shipdate <= date '1998-12-01' - interval '90' day
GROUP BY
    l_returnflag,
    l_linestatus
ORDER BY
    l_returnflag,
    l_linestatus;
```
```nofmt
 l_returnflag | l_linestatus | sum_qty  | sum_base_price | sum_disc_price  |    sum_charge     |      avg_qty       |     avg_price      |      avg_disc       | count_order

```

### Sizing a source

To provision a specific amount of CPU and memory to a source on creation, use the `SIZE` option:

```sql
CREATE SOURCE auction_load
  FROM LOAD GENERATOR AUCTION
  WITH (SIZE = '3xsmall');
```

To resize the source after creation:

```sql
ALTER SOURCE auction_load SET (SIZE = 'large');
```

The smallest source size (`3xsmall`) is a resonable default to get started. For more details on sizing sources, check the [`CREATE SOURCE`](../#sizing-a-source) documentation page.
