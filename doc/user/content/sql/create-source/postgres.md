This document details how to connect Materialize to a Postgres database for Postgres versions 10 and higher. Before you create the source in Materialize, you must perform [some prerequisite steps](#postgresql-source-details) in Postgres.
{{% /create-source/intro %}}

## Syntax

{{< diagram "create-source-postgres.svg" >}}

Field | Use
------|-----
**MATERIALIZED** | Materializes the source's data, which retains all data in memory and makes sources directly selectable. **Currently required for all Postgres sources.** For more information, see [API Components &mdash; Materialized sources](/overview/api-components/#materialized-sources).
_src_name_  | The name for the source.
**IF NOT EXISTS**  | Do nothing (except issuing a notice) if a source with the same name already exists. _Default._
**CONNECTION** _connection_info_ | Postgres connection parameters. See the Postgres documentation on [supported correction parameters](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS) for details.
**PUBLICATION** _publication_name_ | Postgres [publication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html) (the replication data set containing the tables to be streamed to Materialize).

## `WITH` options

The following option is valid within the `WITH` clause.

Field | Value type | Description
------|------------|------------
`timestamp_frequency_ms`  |  `int` |  Default: `1000`. Sets the timestamping frequency in `ms`. Reflects how frequently the source advances its timestamp. This measure reflects how stale data in views will be. Lower values result in more-up-to-date views but may reduce throughput.

## PostgreSQL source details

Materialize makes use of PostgreSQL's native replication capabilities to create a continuously updated replica of the desired Postgres tables.

Before creating the source in Materialize, you must:

1. Set up your Postgres database to allow logical replication.

1. Ensure that the user for your Materialize connection has `REPLICATION` privileges.

1. Make sure replica identity is set to `FULL` for all tables you want to stream to Materialize.

     As a heads-up, you should expect a performance hit in the database from increased CPU usage. For more information, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html).

1. Create a Postgres [publication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html), or replication data set, containing the tables to be streamed to Materialize. Since Postgres sources are materialized (kept in memory) in their entirety, we strongly recommend that you limit publications only to the data you need to query.

Once you create a materialized source from the publication, the source will contain the raw data stream of replication updates. You can then break the stream out into views that represent the publication's original tables with [`CREATE VIEWS`](/sql/create-views/). You can treat these tables as you would any other source and create other views or materialized views from them.

### Postgres schemas

`CREATE VIEWS` will attempt to create each upstream table in the same schema as Postgres. For example, if the publication contains tables `"public"."foo"` and `"otherschema"."foo"`, `CREATE VIEWS` is the equivalent of:

```
CREATE VIEW "public"."foo";
CREATE VIEW "otherschema"."foo";
```

Therefore, in order for `CREATE VIEWS` to succeed, all upstream schemas included in the publication must exist in Materialize as well, or you must explicitly specify the downstream schemas and rename the resulting tables. For example:

```sql
CREATE VIEWS FROM "mz_source"
("public"."foo" AS "foo", "otherschema"."foo" AS "foo2");
```
### Postgres replication slots

{{< warning >}}
Make sure to delete any replication slots if you stop using Materialize or if either your Materialize or Postgres instances crash.
{{< /warning >}}

If you stop or delete Materialize without first dropping the Postgres source, the Postgres replication slot isn't deleted and will continue to accumulate data. In such cases, you should manually delete the Materialize replication slot to recover memory and avoid degraded performance in the upstream database. Materialize replication slot names always begin with `materialize_` for easy identification.

### Restrictions on Postgres sources

- **Schema changes:** Materialize does not support changes to schemas for existing publications. You need to drop the existing sources and then recreate them after creating new publications for the updated schemas.
- **Supported data types:** Sources can only be created from publications that use [data types](/sql/types/) supported by Materialize. Attempts to create sources from publications which contain unsupported data types will fail with an error.
- **Truncation:** Tables replicated into Materialize should not be truncated. If a table is truncated while replicated, the whole source becomes inaccessible and will not produce any data until it is re-created.
- **Resource usage:**
    - During the initial table sync, **disk space** consumption may increase proportionally to the size of the upstream database before returning to a steady state. To profile disk usage, see [Troubleshooting](/ops/troubleshooting/#how-much-disk-space-is-materialize-using).
    - Since Postgres sources are materialized by default, the replicated Postgres source tables must fit into **available memory**.

### Supported Postgres versions

Postgres sources in Materialize require that upstream Postgres instances be [version 10](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-10-released-1786/) or greater.

## Examples

### Setting up PostgreSQL

Before you create a Postgres source in Materialize, you must complete the following prerequisite steps in Postgres.

1. Ensure the database configuration allows logical replication. For most configurations, it should suffice to set `wal_level = logical` in `postgresql.conf`.

    **Note:** If you're using Postgres on a Cloud service like Amazon RDS, AWS Aurora, or Cloud SQL, you'll need to take some additional steps. For more information, see [Postgres CDC in the Cloud](/guides/postgres-cloud/).

2. Assign the user `REPLICATION` privileges:
    ```sql
    ALTER ROLE "user" WITH REPLICATION;
    ```
3. Set replica identity to full for all the tables that you wish to replicate:
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE foo
    REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
    ```

    This setting determines the amount of information that is written to the WAL in `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations. Setting it to `FULL` will include the previous values of all the tableâ€™s columns in the change events.

    As a heads-up, you should expect a performance hit in the database from increased CPU usage. For more information, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html).

4. Create a publication containing all the tables you wish to query in Materialize:

    *For all tables in Postgres:*
    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION mz_source FOR ALL TABLES;
    ```

    *For specific tables:*
    ```sql
    CREATE PUBLICATION mz_source FOR TABLE table1, table2;
    ```

### Creating a source

Once you have set up Postgres, you can create the source in Materialize.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED SOURCE "mz_source" FROM POSTGRES
CONNECTION 'host=postgres port=5432 user=host sslmode=require dbname=postgres'
PUBLICATION 'mz_source';
```

This creates a source that...

- Connects to a Postgres server
- Contains raw data from all of the tables that went into the publication
- Needs to broken out into more usable views that reproduce the original Postgres tables

### Creating views

Once you have created the Postgres source, you need to create views that represent the upstream publication's original tables.

*Create views for all tables included in the Postgres publication*

```sql
CREATE VIEWS FROM SOURCE "mz_source";
SHOW FULL VIEWS;
```

*Create views for specific upstream tables*

```sql
CREATE VIEWS FROM SOURCE "mz_source" ("a", "b");
SHOW FULL VIEWS;
```
