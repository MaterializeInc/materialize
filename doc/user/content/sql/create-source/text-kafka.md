Kafka topic.
{{% /create-source/intro %}}

## Syntax

{{< diagram "create-source-text-kafka.svg" >}}

{{% create-source/syntax-details connector="kafka" formats="text bytes" envelopes="upsert append-only" %}}

## Examples

### Upsert on a Kafka topic

```sql
CREATE SOURCE current_predictions
FROM KAFKA BROKER 'localhost:9092' TOPIC 'kv_feed'
FORMAT TEXT
USING SCHEMA FILE '/scratch/kv_feed.json'
ENVELOPE UPSERT;
```

This creates a source that...

- Has its schema in a file on disk, and decodes payload data using that schema.
- Decodes data received from the `kv_feed` topic published by Kafka running on
  `localhost:9092`.
- Uses message keys to determine what should be inserted, deleted, and updated.
- Treats both message keys and values as text.

### Persisting records to local disk

```sql
CREATE SOURCE persisted_records
FROM KAFKA BROKER 'localhost:9092' TOPIC 'data'
WITH (persistence = true)
FORMAT TEXT
```

This creates a source that...

- Is append-only.
- Decodes data received from the `data` topic published by Kafka running on
  `localhost:9092` as text.
- Persists messages from the `data` topic to local disk.
