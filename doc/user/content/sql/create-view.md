`CREATE VIEW` defines a non-materialized view, which simply provides an alias
for the embedded `SELECT` statement.

The results of a view can be incrementally maintained **in memory** within a
[cluster](/get-started/key-concepts/#clusters) by creating an [index](../create-index).
This allows you to serve queries without the overhead of
materializing the view.

## Syntax

{{< diagram "create-view.svg" >}}

Field | Use
------|-----
**TEMP** / **TEMPORARY** | Mark the view as [temporary](#temporary-views).
**OR REPLACE** | If a view exists with the same name, replace it with the view defined in this statement. You cannot replace views that other views depend on, nor can you replace a non-view object with a view.
**IF NOT EXISTS** | If specified, _do not_ generate an error if a view of the same name already exists. <br/><br/>If _not_ specified, throw an error if a view of the same name already exists. _(Default)_
_view&lowbar;name_ | A name for the view.
**(** _col_ident_... **)** | Rename the `SELECT` statement's columns to the list of identifiers, both of which must be the same length. Note that this is required for statements that return multiple columns with the same identifier.
_select&lowbar;stmt_ | The [`SELECT` statement](../select) to embed in the view.

## Details

[//]: # "TODO(morsapaes) Add short usage patterns section + point to relevant
architecture patterns once these exist."

### Temporary views

The `TEMP`/`TEMPORARY` keyword creates a temporary view. Temporary views are
automatically dropped at the end of the SQL session and are not visible to other
connections. They are always created in the special `mz_temp` schema.

Temporary views may depend upon other temporary database objects, but non-temporary
views may not depend on temporary objects.

## Examples

### Creating a view

```sql
CREATE VIEW purchase_sum_by_region
AS
    SELECT sum(purchase.amount) AS region_sum,
           region.id AS region_id
    FROM region
    INNER JOIN user
        ON region.id = user.region_id
    INNER JOIN purchase
        ON purchase.user_id = user.id
    GROUP BY region.id;
```
