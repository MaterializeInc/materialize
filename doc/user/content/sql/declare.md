`DECLARE` creates a cursor, which can be used with
[`FETCH`](/sql/fetch), to retrieve a limited number of rows at a time
from a larger query. Large queries or queries that don't ever complete
([`TAIL`](/sql/tail)) can be difficult to use with many PostgreSQL drivers
that wait until all rows are returned before returning control to an
application. Using `DECLARE` and [`FETCH`](/sql/fetch) allows you to
fetch only some of the rows at a time.
