`DROP INDEX` removes an index from a materialized view. (Non-materialized views do not have any indexes.)

## Syntax

{{< diagram "drop-index.svg" >}}

Field | Use
------|-----
**IF EXISTS** | Do not return an error if the named index doesn't exist.
_index&lowbar;name_ | The name of the index you want to remove.
**CASCADE** | Remove the index and its dependent objects.
**RESTRICT** |  Remove the index. _(Default.)_

**Note:** Since indexes cannot currently have dependent objects, `DROP INDEX`, `DROP INDEX RESTRICT`, and `DROP INDEX CASCADE` all do the same thing.

## Details

### Indexes and materialized views

### Primary indexes

By default, materialized views only have one index, which we call the "primary
index", and which stores the result set of the materialized view's embedded `SELECT`
statement. You can identify the primary index by its name, which follows the
format `<view name>_primary_idx`.

This primary index doesn't follow the constraints for typical for primary indexes in traditional databases; it is simply the first index created on a view. Please keep in mind the following constraints:

* If you remove the primary index, you will not be able to query any columns that are not included in another index for the view.
* If the primary index is the **only** index on the view, you will not be able to query any columns at all and the materialized view will become a non-materialized view. For more details on non-materialized views, see [`CREATE
VIEW`](../create-view).

If you remove the primary index and want to recreate it:

1. Retrieve the view's embedded `SELECT` statement with [`SHOW CREATE
   VIEW`](../show-create-view).
1. Re-create the view as a materialized view with [`CREATE OR REPLACE
   MATERIALIZED VIEW`](../create-materialized-view).

Alternatively, you can also [`CREATE INDEX`](../create-index) to materialize any
view.

## Examples

### Remove an index

```sql
SHOW VIEWS;
```
```nofmt
+-----------------------------------+
| VIEWS                             |
|-----------------------------------|
| ...                               |
| q01                               |
+-----------------------------------+
```
```sql
SHOW INDEXES FROM q01;
```
```nofmt
+------------------------+--------------------------------+-----
| View                   | Key_name                       | ...
|------------------------+--------------------------------+----
| materialize.public.q01 | materialize.public.q01_geo_idx | ...
+------------------------+--------------------------------+-----
```

You can use the unqualified index name (`q01_geo_idx`) rather the fully qualified name (`materialize.public.q01_geo_idx`).

You can remove an index with any of the following commands:

- ```sql
  DROP INDEX q01_geo_idx;
  ```
- ```sql
  DROP INDEX q01_geo_idx RESTRICT;
  ```
- ```sql
  DROP INDEX q01_geo_idx CASCADE;
  ```

### Do not issue an error if attempting to remove a nonexistent index

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS q01_geo_idx;
```
