You can use a `FILTER` clause on an aggregate function to specify which rows are sent to an [aggregate function](../#aggregate-func). Rows for which the `filter_clause` evaluates to true contribute to the aggregation.

Temporal filters cannot be used in aggregate function filters.

## Syntax

## Examples

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS unfiltered,
    -- The FILTER guards the evaluation which might otherwise error.
    COUNT(1 / (5 - i)) FILTER (WHERE i < 5) AS filtered
FROM generate_series(1,10) AS s(i)
```
