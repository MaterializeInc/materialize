`GRANT` grants privileges on a database object.

{{< warning >}}
Currently, roles have limited functionality in Materialize. This is part of the
work to enable **Role-based access control** (RBAC) in a future release {{% gh 11579 %}}.

## Details

For Views, Materialized Views, and Sources, the object type of 'TABLE' must be specified. This is
for PostgreSQL compatibility.

The following tables describes which privileges are applicable on which objects:

| Object Type          | All Privileges |
|----------------------|----------------|
| `DATABASE`           | UC             |
| `SCHEMA`             | UC             |
| `TABLE`              | arwd           |
| `VIEW`               | r              |
| `MATERIALIZED  VIEW` | r              |
| `INDEX`              |                |
| `TYPE`               | U              |
| `SOURCE`             | r              |
| `SINK`               |                |
| `CONNECTION`         | U              |
| `SECRET`             | U              |
| `CLUSTER`            | UC             |

The keyword `PUBLIC` can be used as the _role_name_. This psuedo-role indicates that these
privileges are being granted to all roles, even those that don't exist yet.
Note: Privileges are cumulative. Revoking a privilege from `PUBLIC` does not mean all roles have
lost that privilege, if certain roles were explicitly granted that privilege.

## Examples

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE t TO joe;
```

```sql
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON DATABASE materialize TO joe;
```
