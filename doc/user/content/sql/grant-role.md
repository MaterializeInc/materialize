`GRANT` grants membership of one role to another role.

## Conceptual framework

Roles can be members of other roles and inherit all the attributes and
privileges of the other roles.

{{< warning >}}
Roles in Materialize are currently limited in functionality. In the future they
will be used for role-based access control. See GitHub issue {{% gh 11579 %}}
for details.
