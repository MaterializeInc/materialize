`SELECT` is used in a few ways within Materialize. You can use it to:

- Query materialized views and materialized sources, e.g. `SELECT * FROM
  some_view;`
- Describe a view you want to materialize. e.g. `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW
  some_view AS SELECT...`
- Describe a view without materializing it, e.g. `CREATE VIEW
  some_nonmaterialized_view AS...`

To better understand the distinction between these uses, you should check out
our [architecture overview](../../overview/architecture).

## Conceptual framework

The `SELECT` statement is the root of a SQL query, and is used both to
interactively query data Materialize manages, and to bind SQL queries to named
views which can be queried later.

When used to interactively query data, your query must depend only on
materialized sources and views. There are exceptions, discussed in more detail
below. When used to construct views, this restriction is lifted.

This is covered in much greater detail in our [architecture
overview](../../overview/architecture), but here's a quick summary of how
Materialize handles `SELECT` in different circumstances.

Scenario | `SELECT` behavior
---------|------------------
**Creating view** | The query description is bound to the name given to it by `CREATE VIEW`.
**Reading from a materialized source or view** | Reads directly from the maintained data.
**Querying materialized sources and views** | Constructs a dataflow, which is torn down after returning results to the client.

## Syntax

{{< diagram "select-stmt.svg" >}}

Field | Use
------|-----
**WITH** ... **AS** ... | [Common table expressions](#common-table-expressions-ctes) (CTEs) for this query.
**(** _col&lowbar;ident_... **)** | Rename the CTE's columns to the list of identifiers, both of which must be the same length.
**ALL** | Return all rows from query _(implied default)_.
**DISTINCT** | Return only distinct values from query.
**DISTINCT ON (** _col&lowbar;ref_... **)**  | Return only the first row with a distinct value for _col&lowbar;ref_. {{< version-added v0.5.1 />}}
_target&lowbar;elem_ | Return identified columns or functions.
**FROM** _table&lowbar;ref_ | The tables you want to read from; note that these can also be other `SELECT` statements or [common table expressions](#common-table-expressions-ctes).
_join&lowbar;expr_ | A join expression; for more details, see our [`JOIN` documentation](../join).
**WHERE** _expression_ | Filter tuples by _expression_.
**GROUP BY** _col&lowbar;ref_ | Group aggregations by _col&lowbar;ref_.
**OPTION (** _hint&lowbar;list_ **)** | Specify one or more [query hints](#query-hints).
**HAVING** _expression_ | Filter aggregations by _expression_.
**ORDER BY** _col&lowbar;ref_... | Order results in either **ASC** or **DESC** order (_**ASC** is implied default_).<br/><br>
**LIMIT** | Limit the number of returned results to _expr_.
**OFFSET** | Skip the first _expr_ number of rows.
**UNION** | Records present in `select_stmt` or `another_select_stmt`.<br/><br/>**DISTINCT** returns only unique rows from these results _(implied default)_.<br/><br/>With **ALL** specified, each record occurs a number of times equal to the sum of the times it occurs in each input statement.
**INTERSECT** | Records present in both `select_stmt` and `another_select_stmt`.<br/><br/>**DISTINCT** returns only unique rows from these results _(implied default)_.<br/><br/>With **ALL** specified, each record occurs a number of times equal to the lesser of the times it occurs in each input statement.
**EXCEPT** | Records present in `select_stmt` but not in `another_select_stmt`.<br/><br/>**DISTINCT** returns only unique rows from these results _(implied default)_.<br/><br/>With **ALL** specified, each record occurs a number of times equal to the times it occurs in `select_stmt` less the times it occurs in `another_select_stmt`, or not at all if the former is greater than latter.
**AS OF** | If provided, `SELECT` will report the results at the supplied timestamp, meaning it reflects exactly those input updates at or before this timestamp.

## Details

Because Materialize works very differently from a traditional RDBMS, it's
important to understand the implications that certain features of `SELECT` will
impact your Materialize instances.

### Creating materialized views

Creating a materialized view generates a persistent dataflow, which has a
different performance profile from performing a `SELECT` in an RDBMS.

A materialized view costs Materialize both CPU and RAM to maintain. Materialize
must maintain the results of the query, but often it must also maintain
additional intermediate state. To learn more about the costs of materialization,
check out our [architecture overview](../../overview/architecture).

### Reading from sources and views

Performing a `SELECT * FROM` a materialized source or materialized view is
Materialize's ideal operation. When Materialize receives such a `SELECT` query,
it quickly returns the maintained results from memory, with no re-execution.

Materialize also quickly returns results for queries that only filter, project,
and re-order results of materialized sources or materialized views.

### Querying sources and views

{{< warning >}}
You can <code>SELECT</code> from non-materialized views only if they are
transitively materialized. For more information, see [`CREATE VIEW`: Querying
non-materialized
views](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-view/#querying-non-materialized-views).
{{< /warning >}}

Performing a `SELECT` query that does not directly read out of a materialization
requires Materialize to evaluate your query. Materialize will construct a
temporary dataflow to materialize your query, and remove the dataflow as soon as
it returns the query results to you.

When you perform a `SELECT` query, all of your inputs must be *queryable*. An
input is queryable if it is a constant collection, materialized, or it depends
only on queryable inputs itself. The main reason an input might not be queryable
is it if relies on an unmaterialized source for its definition.

You can create a materialized view out of any query using [`CREATE MATERIALIZED
VIEW`](../create-materialized-view), and it will always then be queryable.

If you supply an `AS OF <time>` argument to your `SELECT` query the queryable
requirement is lifted.

### Common table expressions (CTEs)

Common table expressions, also known as CTEs and `WITH` queries, create aliases
for statements that subsequent expressions can refer to (including subsquent
CTEs). This can enhance legibility of complex queries, but doesn't alter the
queries' semantics.

For an example, see [Using CTEs](#using-ctes).

### Query hints

{{< version-added v0.6.0 />}}

Users can specify any query hints to help Materialize optimize
query planning more efficiently.

The following query hints are valid within the `OPTION` clause.

Hint | Value type | Description
------|------------|------------
`expected_group_size` | `int` | How many rows will have the same group key. Materialize
can render `min` and `max` expressions more efficiently with this information.

For an example, see [Using query hints](#using-query-hints).

#### Known limitations

CTEs have the following limitations, which we are working to improve:

- CTEs only support `SELECT` queries. {{% gh 4867 %}}
- Materialize inlines the CTE where it's referenced, which could cause
  unexpected performance characteristics for especially complex expressions. {{%
  gh 4867 %}}
- `WTIH RECURSIVE` CTEs are not available yet. {{% gh 2516 %}}

## Examples

### Creating a view

This assumes you've already [created a source](../create-source).

The following query creates a materialized view representing the total of all
purchases made by users per region.

``` sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mat_view AS
    SELECT region.id, sum(purchase.total)
    FROM mysql_simple_purchase AS purchase
    JOIN mysql_simple_user AS user ON purchase.user_id = user.id
    JOIN mysql_simple_region AS region ON user.region_id = region.id
    GROUP BY region.id;
```

In this case, Materialized will create a dataflow to maintain the results of
this query, and that dataflow will live on until the view it's maintaining is
dropped.

### Reading from a view

Assuming you create the view listed above, named `mat_view`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM mat_view
```

In this case, Materialized simply returns the results of the dataflow you
created to maintain the view.

### Querying views

```sql
SELECT region.id, sum(purchase.total)
FROM mysql_simple_purchase AS purchase
JOIN mysql_simple_user AS user ON purchase.user_id = user.id
JOIN mysql_simple_region AS region ON user.region_id = region.id
GROUP BY region.id;
```

In this case, Materialized will spin up the same dataflow as it did for creating
a materialized view, but it will tear down the dataflow once it's returned its
results to the client. If you regularly want to view the results of this query,
you may want to [create a view](../create-view) for it.

### Using CTEs

```sql
WITH
  regional_sales (region, total_sales) AS (
    SELECT region, sum(amount)
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY region
  ),
  top_regions AS (
    SELECT region
    FROM regional_sales
    ORDER BY total_sales DESC
    LIMIT 5
  )
SELECT region,
       product,
       SUM(quantity) AS product_units,
       SUM(amount) AS product_sales
FROM orders
WHERE region IN (SELECT region FROM top_regions)
GROUP BY region, product;
```

Both `regional_sales` and `top_regions` are CTEs. You could write a query that
produces the same results by replacing references to the CTE with the query it
names, but the CTEs make the entire query simpler to understand.

With regard to dataflows, this is similar to [Querying views](#querying-views)
above: Materialize tears down the created dataflow after returning the results.

### Using query hints

```sql
SELECT a,
       min(b) AS min
FROM example
GROUP BY a
OPTION (expected_group_size = 100)
```

Here the hint indicates that there may be up to a hundred distinct `(a, b)` pairs
for each `a` value, and Materialize can optimize its dataflow rendering with that
knowledge.
