`SHOW SOURCES` returns a list of all sources available to your Materialize
instances.

## Syntax

{{< diagram "show-sources.svg" >}}

Field | Use
------|-----
_schema&lowbar;name_ | The schema to show sources from. Defaults to `public` in the current database. For available schemas, see [`SHOW SCHEMAS`](../show-schemas).
**MATERIALIZED** | Only return materialized sources, i.e. those with [indexes](../create-index). Without specifying this option, this command returns all sources, including non-materialized sources.
**FULL** | Return details about your sources.

## Details

### Output format for `SHOW FULL SOURCES`

`SHOW FULL SOURCES`'s output is a table, with this structure:

```nofmt
 name  | type | materialized | volatility
-------+------+--------------+-----------
 ...   | ...  | ...          | ...
```

Field | Meaning
------|--------
**name** | The name of the source
**type** | Whether the source was created by the `user` or the `system`
**materialized** | Does the source have an in-memory index? For more details, see [`CREATE INDEX`](../create-index)
**volatility** | Whether the source is [volatile](/overview/volatility). Either `volatile`, `nonvolatile`, or `unknown`.

{{< version-changed v0.5.0 >}}
The output column is renamed from `SOURCES` to `name`.
{{< /version-changed >}}

{{< version-added v0.7.2 >}}
The `volatile` column.
{{< /version-added >}}

### Internal statistic sources

Materialize comes with a number of sources that contain internal statistics
about the instance's behavior. These are kept in a "hidden" schema called
`mz_catalog`.

To view the internal statistic sources use:

```sql
SHOW SOURCES FROM mz_catalog;
```

To select from these sources, you must specify that you want to read from the
source in the `mz_catalog` schema.

## Examples

### Default behavior

```sql
SHOW SCHEMAS;
```
```nofmt
public
```
```sql
SHOW SOURCES FROM public;
```
```nofmt
my_stream_source
my_file_source
```
```sql
SHOW SOURCES;
```
```nofmt
my_stream_source
my_file_source
```

### Only show materialized sources

```sql
SHOW MATERIALIZED SOURCES;
```
```nofmt
        name
----------------------
 my_materialized_source
```

### Show details about sources

```sql
SHOW FULL SOURCES
```
```nofmt
            name           | type | materialized
---------------------------+------+--------------
 my_nonmaterialized_source | user | f
 my_materialized_source    | user | t
```
