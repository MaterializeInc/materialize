Materialize exposes a system catalog that contains metadata about the running
Materialize instance.

{{< warning >}}
The system tables are not part of Materialize's stable interface.
Backwards-incompatible changes to these tables may be made at any time.
{{< /warning >}}

## Details

The system catalog consists of two schemas that are implicitly available in
all databases:

  * [`mz_catalog`](#mz_catalog), which exposes metadata in Materialize's
    native format.

  * [`pg_catalog`](#pg_catalog), which presents the data in `mz_catalog` in
    the format used by PostgreSQL.

These schemas contain sources, tables, and views that expose metadata like:

  * Descriptions of each database, schema, source, table, view, sink, and
    index in the system.

  * Descriptions of all running dataflows.

  * Metrics about dataflow execution.

Whenever possible, applications should prefer to query `mz_catalog` over
`pg_catalog`. The mapping between Materialize concepts and PostgreSQL concepts
is not one-to-one, and so the data in `pg_catalog` cannot accurately represent
the particulars of Materialize. For example, PostgreSQL has no notion of
[sinks](/sql/create-sink), and therefore `pg_catalog` does not display
information about the sinks available in a Materialize.

`dataflow_id`  | [`bigint`] | The ID of the dataflow responsible for processing this source.
`partition_id` | [`text`]   | The ID of the partition within the source. The concept of partition varies by source type. Not all sources types have multiple partitions, in which case there will be only one entry for partition ID `0`.
`offset`       | [`bigint`] | The highest offset processed by this source.
`timestamp`    | [`bigint`] | The largest `mz_timestamp` processed by this source.

### `mz_sources`

The `mz_sources` table contains a row for each source in the system.

`oid`          | [`oid`]     | A [PostgreSQL-compatible OID][oid] for the view.
`schema_id`    | [`bigint`]  | The ID of the schema to which the view belongs.
`name`         | [`text`]    | The name of the view.
`volatility`   | [`text`]    | Whether the view is [volatile](/overview/volatility). Either `volatile`, `nonvolatile`, or `unknown`.

### `mz_worker_materialization_frontiers`

The `mz_worker_materialization_frontiers` source describes each worker's
frontier for each [dataflow] in the system. The frontier describes the earliest
timestamp at which the output of the dataflow may change; data prior to that
timestamp is sealed.

For frontier information aggregated across all workers, see
[`mz_materialization_frontiers`](#mz_materialization_frontiers).

Field       | Type       | Meaning
------------|------------|--------
`global_id` | [`text`]   | The ID of the index that created the dataflow. Corresponds to [`mz_indexes.id`](#mz_indexes).
`worker`    | [`bigint`] | The ID of the worker thread hosting the dataflow.
`time`      | [`bigint`] | The next timestamp at which the dataflow may change.

## `pg_catalog`

Materialize has compatibility shims for the following relations from [PostgreSQL's
system catalog](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalogs.html):

  * [`pg_am`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-am.html)
  * [`pg_attribute`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-attribute.html)
  * [`pg_class`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-class.html)
  * [`pg_collation`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-collation.html)
  * [`pg_constraint`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-constraint.html)
  * [`pg_database`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-database.html)

  * [`pg_enum`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-enum.html)
  * [`pg_index`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-index.html)

  * [`pg_proc`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-proc.html)
  * [`pg_range`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-range.html)
  * [`pg_roles`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-roles.html)
  * [`pg_settings`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-settings.html)
  * [`pg_tables`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-tables.html)
  * [`pg_type`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-type.html)
  * [`pg_views`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-views.html)

These compatibility shims are largely incomplete. Most are lacking some columns
that are present in PostgreSQL, or if they do include the column the result set
its value may always be `NULL`. The precise nature of the incompleteness is
intentionally undocumented. New tools developed against Materialize should use
the documented [`mz_catalog`](#mz_catalog) API instead.

If you are having trouble making a PostgreSQL tool work with Materialize, please
[file a GitHub issue][gh-issue]. Many PostgreSQL tools can be made to work with
Materialize with minor changes to the `pg_catalog` compatibility shim.

## `information_schema`

Materialize has compatibility shims for the following relations from the
SQL standard [`information_schema`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/infoschema-schema.html)
schema, which is automatically available in all databases:

  * [`columns`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/infoschema-columns.html)
  * [`tables`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/infoschema-tables.html)

These compatibility shims are largely incomplete. Most are lacking some columns
that are present in the SQL standard, or if they do include the column the
result set its value may always be `NULL`. The precise nature of the
incompleteness is intentionally undocumented. New tools developed against
Materialize should use the documented [`mz_catalog`](#mz_catalog) API instead.
