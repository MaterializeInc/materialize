### `mz_source_statistics`

The `mz_source_statistics` table contains statistics for each worker thread of
each source in the system.

Materialize does not make any guarantees about the exactness or freshness of
these statistics. They are occasionally reset to zero as internal components of
the system are restarted.

Field                 | Type         | Meaning
----------------------|--------------|--------
`id`                  | [`text`]     | The ID of the source. Corresponds to [`mz_catalog.mz_sources.id`](../mz_catalog#mz_sources).

### `mz_sink_statistics`

The `mz_sink_statistics` table contains statistics for each worker thread of

`messaged_commited`   | [`bigint`]   | The number of messages committed to the sink.
`bytes_staged`        | [`bigint`]   | The number of bytes staged but possibly not committed to the sink. This counts both keys and values, if applicable.
`bytes_committed`     | [`bigint`]   | The number of bytes committed to the sink. This counts both keys and values, if applicable.

The values in this table may change at any time, and users should not rely on
them for any kind of capacity planning.
