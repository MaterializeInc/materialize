The following sections describe the available objects in the `mz_internal`
schema.

{{< warning >}}
The objects in the `mz_internal` schema are not part of Materialize's stable interface.
Backwards-incompatible changes to these objects may be made at any time.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< warning >}}
`SELECT` statements may reference these objects, but creating views that
reference these objects is not allowed.

## `mz_recent_activity_log`

{{< public-preview />}}

{{< warning >}}
Do not rely on all statements being logged in this view. Materialize
controls the maximum rate at which statements are sampled, and may change
this rate at any time.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< warning >}}
Entries in this view may be cleared on restart (e.g., during Materialize maintenance windows).
{{< /warning >}}

The `mz_recent_activity_log` view contains a log of the SQL statements
that have been issued to Materialize in the last 24 hours, along
with various metadata about them.

Entries in this log may be sampled. The sampling rate is controlled by
the configuration parameter `statement_logging_sample_rate`, which may be set
to any value between 0 and 1. For example, to disable statement
logging entirely for a session, execute `SET
statement_logging_sample_rate TO 0`. Materialize may apply a lower
sampling rate than the one set in this parameter.

The view can be accessed by Materialize _superusers_ or users that have been
granted the [`mz_monitor` role](/manage/access-control/manage-roles#builtin-roles).

## `mz_index_advice`

{{< warning >}}
Following the advice in this view might not always yield resource usage
optimizations. You should test any changes in a development environment
before deploying the changes to production.
{{< /warning >}}

The `mz_index_advice` view provides advice on opportunities to optimize resource
usage (memory and CPU) in Materialize. The advice provided suggests either
creating indexes or materialized views to precompute intermediate results that
can be reused across several objects, or removing unnecessary indexes or
materialized views.


### Known limitations

The suggestions are based on the graph of dependencies between objects and do
not take into account other important factors, like the actual usage patterns
and execution plans. This means that following the advice in this view **might
not always lead to resource usage optimizations**. In some cases, the provided
advice might lead to suboptimal execution plans or even increased resource
usage. For example:

- If a materialized view or an index has been created for direct querying, the
  dependency graph will not reflect this nuance and `mz_index_advice` might
  recommend using an unindexed view instead. In this case, you should refer to
  the reference documentation for [query optimization](/transform-data/optimization/#indexes)
  instead.
- If a view is depended on by multiple objects that use very selective filters,
  or multiple projections that can be pushed into or even beyond the view,
  adding an index may increase resource usage.
- If an index has been created to [enable delta joins](/transform-data/optimization/#optimize-multi-way-joins-with-delta-joins),
  removing it may lead to lower memory utilization, but the delta join
  optimization will no longer be used in the join implementation.

To guarantee that there are no regressions given your specific usage patterns,
it's important to test any changes in a development environment before
deploying the changes to production.

### Counter metrics

`messages_received`, `bytes_received`, `updates_staged`, and `updates_committed`
are counter metrics that monotonically increase over time.

Counters are updated in a best-effort manner. An ill-timed restart of the source
may cause undercounting or overcounting. As a result, **counters are only useful
for calculating rates to understand the general performance of your source.**

For Postgres and MySQL sources, `messages_received` and `bytes_received` are
collected on the top-level source, and `updates_staged` and `updates_committed`
are collected on the source's tables.

### Gauge metrics

Gauge metrics reflect values that can increase or decrease over time. Gauge
metrics are eventually consistent. They may lag the true state of the source by
seconds or minutes, but if the source stops ingesting messages, the gauges will
eventually reflect the true state of the source.

`records_indexed` and `bytes_indexed` are the size (in records and bytes
respectively) of the index the source must maintain internally to efficiently
process incoming data. Currently, only sources that use the upsert and Debezium
envelopes must maintain an index. These gauges reset to 0 when the source is
restarted, as the index must be rehydrated.

`rehydration_latency` represents the amount of time it took for the source to
rehydrate its index after the latest restart. It is reset to `NULL` when a
source is restarted and is populated with a duration after hydration finishes.

When a source is first created, it must process an initial snapshot of data.
`snapshot_records_known` is the total number of records in the snapshot, and
`snapshot_records_staged` is how many of the records the source has read so far.

<a name="meaning-record"></a>

The meaning of record depends on the source:
- For Kafka sources, its the total number of offsets in the snapshot.
- For Postgres and MySQL sources, its the number of rows in the snapshot.

Note that when tables are added to Postgres or MySQL sources,
`snapshot_records_known` and `snapshot_records_staged` will reset as the source
snapshots those new tables. The metrics will also reset if the source is
restarted while the snapshot is in progres.

`snapshot_committed` becomes true when we have fully committed the snapshot for
the given source. <!-- TODO: when does this reset? -->

`offset_known` and `offset_committed` are used to represent the progress a
source is making relative to its upstream source. `offset_known` is the maximum
offset in the upstream system that Materialize knows about. `offset_committed`
is the offset that Materialize has durably ingested. These metrics will never
decrease over the lifetime of a source.

<a name="meaning-offset"></a>

The meaning of offset depends on the source:
- For Kafka sources, an offset is the Kafka message offset.
- For MySQL sources, an offset is the number of transactions committed across all servers in the cluster.
- For Postgres sources, an offset is a log sequence number (LSN).

## `mz_statement_execution_history`

The `mz_statement_execution_history` table contains a row for each
statement executed, that the system decided to log. Entries older than
thirty days may be removed.

The system chooses to log statements randomly; the probability of
logging an execution is controlled by the
`statement_logging_sample_rate` configuration parameter. A value of 0 means
to log nothing; a value of 0.8 means to log approximately 80% of
statement executions. If `statement_logging_sample_rate` is higher
than `statement_logging_max_sample_rate` (which is set by Materialize
and cannot be changed by users), the latter is used instead.
