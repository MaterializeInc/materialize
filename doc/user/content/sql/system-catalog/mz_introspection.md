The following sections describe the available objects in the `mz_introspection`
schema.

{{< warning >}}
The objects in the `mz_introspection` schema are not part of Materialize's stable interface.
Backwards-incompatible changes to these objects may be made at any time.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< warning >}}
`SELECT` statements may reference these objects, but creating views that
reference these objects is not allowed.
{{< /warning >}}

Introspection relations are maintained by independently collecting internal logging information within each of the replicas of a cluster.
Thus, in a multi-replica cluster, queries to these relations need to be directed to a specific replica by issuing the command `SET cluster_replica = <replica_name>`.
Note that once this command is issued, all subsequent `SELECT` queries, for introspection relations or not, will be directed to the targeted replica.
Replica targeting can be cancelled by issuing the command `RESET cluster_replica`.

For each of the below introspection relations, there exists also a variant with a `_per_worker` name suffix.
Per-worker relations expose the same data as their global counterparts, but have an extra `worker_id` column that splits the information by Timely Dataflow worker.

## `mz_active_peeks`

The `mz_active_peeks` view describes all read queries ("peeks") that are pending in the [dataflow] layer.

## `mz_lir_mapping`

The `mz_lir_mapping` view describes the low-level internal representation (LIR) plan that corresponds to global ids.
LIR is a higher-level representation than dataflows; this view is used for profiling and debugging indices and materialized views.
Note that LIR is not a stable interface and may change at any time.
In particular, you should not attempt to parse `operator` descriptions.
LIR nodes are implemented by zero or more dataflow operators with sequential ids.
We use the range `[operator_id_start, operator_id_end)` to record this information.
If an LIR node was implemented without any dataflow operators, `operator_id_start` will be equal to `operator_id_end`.
