`TAIL` continually reports updates that occur to a source or view.
For materialized sources or views this data only represents updates that occur after running the `TAIL` command.
For non-materialized sources or views, all updates are presented.

Tail will continue to run until cancelled, or until all updates the tailed item could undergo have been presented. The latter case may happen with static views (e.g. `SELECT true`), files without the `tail = true` modifier, or other settings in which a collection can cease to experience updates.

In order for a tail to be possible, all involved sources must be valid to read from at the chosen timestamp.
A tail at a given timestamp might not be possible if data it would report has already been compacted by Materialize.

## Syntax

{{< diagram "tail.html" >}}

Field | Use
------|-----
_object&lowbar;name_ | The item you want to tail
_timestamp&lowbar;expression_ | The logical time to tail from onwards (either a number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch, or a `TIMESTAMP` or `TIMESTAMPTZ`).

## Details

### Output

`TAIL`'s output is:

```shell
[tab-separated column values] Diff: [diff value] at [logical timestamp]
```

Field | Represents
------|-----------
`tab-separated column values` | The row's columns' values separated by tab characters.
`diff value` | Whether the record is an insert (`1`), delete (`-1`), or update (delete for old value, followed by insert of new value).
`logical timestamp` | Materialize's internal logical timestamp.

### AS OF

You can choose a point in time to begin reporting events using `AS OF`.
If you don't use `AS OF`, Materialize will pick a timestamp itself.

### WITH SNAPSHOT

If you specify `WITH SNAPSHOT`, a snapshot of the state of the system at the chosen timestamp will be reported in addition to any subsequent events.
This means that you will see any updates that occur up to and including the chosen timestamp.

## Example

In this example, we'll assume `some_materialized_view` has one `text` column.

```sql
TAIL some_materialized_view
```
```
insert_key   Diff: 1 at 1585752182327
will_delete  Diff: 1 at 1585752197827
will_delete  Diff: -1 at 1585752335626
will_update_old  Diff: 1 at 1585752351626
will_update_old  Diff: -1 at 1585752356422
will_update_new  Diff: 1 at 1585752356422
````

This represents:

- Inserting `insert_key`.
- Inserting and then deleting `will_delete`.
- Inserting `will_update_old`, and then updating it to `will_update_new`

If we wanted to see the updates that had occurred in the last 30 seconds, we could run:

```sql
TAIL some_materialized_view AS OF now() - '30s'::INTERVAL
```
