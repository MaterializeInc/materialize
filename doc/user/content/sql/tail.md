`TAIL` streams updates from a source, table, or view as they occur.

## Conceptual framework

The `TAIL` statement is a more general form of a [`SELECT`](/sql/select)
statement. While a `SELECT` statement computes a relation at a moment in time, a
tail operation computes how a relation *changes* over time.

Fundamentally, `TAIL` produces a sequence of updates. An update describes either
the insertion or deletion of a row to the relation at a specific time. Taken
together, the updates describes the complete set of changes to a relation, in
order, while the `TAIL` is active.

Clients can use `TAIL` to:

  - Power event processors that react to every change to a relation.
  - Replicate the complete history of a relation while the `TAIL` is active.

## Syntax

{{< diagram "tail-stmt.svg" >}}

Field | Use
------|-----
_object&lowbar;name_ | The name of the source, table, or view that you want to tail.
_timestamp&lowbar;expression_ | The logical time at which the `TAIL` begins as a [`bigint`] representing milliseconds since the Unix epoch. See [`AS OF`](#as-of) below.

Supported `WITH` option values:

Option name | Value type | Default | Describes
------------|------------|---------|----------
`SNAPSHOT`  | `bool`     | `true`  | Whether to emit a snapshot of the current state of the relation at the start of the operation. See [`SNAPSHOT`](#snapshot) below.
`PROGRESS`  | `bool`     | `false` | Whether to include detailed progress information. See [`PROGRESS`](#progress) below.

## Details

### Output

`TAIL` emits a sequence of updates. Each row contains all of the columns of
the tailed relation, prepended with several additional columns that describe
the nature of the update:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Column</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Represents</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><code>timestamp</code></td>
    <td><code>numeric</code></td>
    <td>
      Materialize's internal logical timestamp. This will never be less than any
      timestamp previously emitted by the same <code>TAIL</code> operation.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>progressed</code></td>
    <td><code>boolean</code></td>
    <td>
      <p>
        <em>
          This column is only present if the
          <a href="#progress"><code>PROGRESS</code></a> option is specified.
        </em>
      </p>
      If <code>true</code>, indicates that the <code>TAIL</code> will not emit
      additional records at times strictly less than <code>timestamp</code>. See
      <a href="#progress"><code>PROGRESS</code></a> below.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>diff</code></td>
    <td><code>bigint</code></td>
    <td>
      The change in frequency of the row. A positive number indicates that
      <code>diff</code> copies of the row were inserted, while a negative
      number indicates that <code>|diff|</code> copies of the row were deleted.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Column 1</td>
    <td>Varies</td>
    <td rowspan="3" style="vertical-align: middle; border-left: 1px solid #ccc">
        The columns from the tailed relation, each as its own column,
        representing the data that was inserted into or deleted from the
        relation.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" style="text-align: center">...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Column <em>N</em></td>
    <td>Varies</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

`TAIL` will continue to run until cancelled, or until all updates the tailed
item could undergo have been presented. The latter case typically occurs when
tailing constant views (e.g. `CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT 1`) or
[file sources](/sql/create-source/text-file) that were created in non-tailing
mode (`tail = false`).

{{< version-changed v0.5.1 >}}
The timestamp and diff information moved to leading, well-typed columns.
Previously the timestamp and diff information was encoded in a human-readable
string in a trailing [`text`](/sql/types/text) column.
{{</ version-changed >}}

{{< version-changed v0.5.1 >}}
`TAIL` sends rows to the client normally, i.e., as if they were sent by a
[`SELECT`](/sql/select) statement. Previously `TAIL` was implicitly wrapped in
a [`COPY TO`](/sql/copy-to) statement.
{{</ version-changed >}}

{{< version-changed v0.5.2 >}}
`TAIL` is now guaranteed to send timestamps in non-decreasing order.
{{</ version-changed >}}

{{< version-changed v0.5.2 >}}
Syntax has changed. `WITH SNAPSHOT` is now `WITH (SNAPSHOT)`.
`WITHOUT SNAPSHOT` is now `WITH (SNAPSHOT = false)`.
{{</ version-changed >}}

{{< version-changed v0.5.2 >}}
The [`PROGRESS`](#progress) option has been added.
{{</ version-changed >}}

### `AS OF`

The `AS OF` clause specifies the time at which a `TAIL` operation begins.
See [`SNAPSHOT`](#snapshot) below for details on what this means.

If you don't specify `AS OF` explicitly, Materialize will pick a timestamp
automatically:

  - If the tailed relation is [materialized](/overview/api-components/#indexes),
    Materialize picks the latest time for which results are computed.
  - If the tailed relation is not materialized, Materialize picks time `0`.

A given timestamp will be rejected if data it would report has already been
compacted by Materialize. See the
[`--logical-compaction-window`](/cli/#compaction-window) command-line option for
details on Materialize's compaction policy.

### `SNAPSHOT`

By default, a `TAIL` begins by emitting a snapshot of the tailed relation, which
consists of a series of updates describing the contents of the relation at its
[`AS OF`](#as-of) timestamp. After the snapshot, `TAIL` emits further updates as
they occur.

For updates in the snapshot, the `timestamp` field will be fast-forwarded to the
`AS OF` timestamp. For example, `TAIL ... AS OF 21` would present an insert that
occured at time 15 as if it occurred at time 21.

To see only updates after the `AS OF` timestamp, specify `WITH (SNAPSHOT =
false)`.

### `PROGRESS`

If the `PROGRESS` option is specified via `WITH (PROGRESS)`, an additional
`progressed` column appears in the output.
It is `false` if there may be more rows with the same timestamp.
It is `true` if no more timestamps will appear that are strictly less than the
timestamp.
All further columns after `progressed` will be `NULL` in the `true` case.

Intuitively, progress messages communicate that no updates have occurred in a
given time window. Without explicit progress messages, it is impossible to
distinguish between a stall in Materialize and a legimate period of no updates.

Not all timestamps that appear will have a corresponding `progressed` row.
For example, the following is a valid sequence of updates:

`timestamp` | `progressed` | `diff` | `column1`
------------|--------------|--------|----------------
1           | `false`      | 1      | data
1           | `false`      | 1      | more data
2           | `false`      | 1      | even more data
4           | `true`       | `NULL` | `NULL`

Notice how Materialize did not emit explicit progress messages for timestamps
`1`, `2`, or `3`. The receipt of the update at timestamp `2` implies that there
are no more updates for timestamp `1`, because timestamps are always presented
in non-decreasing order. The receipt of the explicit progress message at
timestamp `4` implies that there are no more updates for either timestamp
`2` or `3`â€”but that there may be more data arriving at timestamp `4`.

## Examples

`TAIL` produces rows similar to a `SELECT` statement, except that `TAIL` may never complete.
Many drivers buffer all results until a query is complete, and so will never return.
Below are the recommended ways to work around this.

### Tailing with `FETCH`

The recommended way to use `TAIL` is with [`DECLARE`](/sql/declare) and [`FETCH`](/sql/fetch).
This allows you to limit the number of rows and the time window of your requests. First, declare a `TAIL` cursor:

```sql
DECLARE c CURSOR FOR TAIL t;
````

Now use [`FETCH`](/sql/fetch) in a loop to retrieve some number of rows within a time window:

```sql
FETCH 100 c WITH (timeout = '1s');
```

That will retrieve up to the next 100 rows that are ready in at most `1s`.
The timeout is only used when there are not any rows ready and a wait must occur.
If `timeout` is not specified it defaults to `0s` which means it will only return rows that are immediately available and will never wait for more to come before completing.

#### `FETCH` with Python and psycopg2

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import psycopg2
import sys

dsn = "postgresql://localhost:6875/materialize?sslmode=disable"
conn = psycopg2.connect(dsn)

with conn.cursor() as cur:
    cur.execute("DECLARE c CURSOR FOR TAIL v")
    while True:
        cur.execute("FETCH 100 c WITH (TIMEOUT = '1s')")
        for row in cur:
            print(row)
    cur.execute("CLOSE c")
```

### Tailing with `COPY TO`

[`COPY TO`](/sql/copy-to) is supported by many drivers and does not buffer.
However most drivers do not provide methods to parse the data coming from the `COPY`, in which case you'll have to do your own parsing.
The PostgreSQL docs describe the [`COPY` text format](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html#id-1.9.3.55.9.2), which is tab-separated lines with
escapes and a sentinel for `NULL`.

#### `COPY TO` with C# and Npgsql

Npgsql supports parsing the `BINARY` format of `COPY TO`:

```
// The TAIL won't ever end, so use reader.Cancel() to cancel the request.
using (var reader = Conn.BeginBinaryExport("COPY (TAIL t) TO STDOUT (FORMAT BINARY)"))
{
    reader.StartRow();
    Console.WriteLine(reader.Read<decimal>()); // timestamp column
    Console.WriteLine(reader.Read<long>()); // diff column
    Console.WriteLine(reader.Read<int>()); // first column of `t`

    // ...
}
```

For more details, see the [Binary `COPY`](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/copy.html#binary-copy) section of the Npgsql documentation.

#### `COPY TO` with Python and psycopg2

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import psycopg2

def main():

    dsn = 'postgresql://localhost:6875/materialize?sslmode=disable'
    conn = psycopg2.connect(dsn)

    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.copy_expert("COPY (TAIL some_materialized_view) TO STDOUT", sys.stdout)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This will then stream the same output we saw above to `stdout`, though you could
obviously do whatever you like with the output from this point.

### Tailing via the `psql` command-line client

In this example, we'll assume `some_materialized_view` has one `text` column.

```sql
COPY (TAIL some_materialized_view) TO STDOUT
```
```
1580000000000  1 insert_key
1580000000001  1 will_delete
1580000000003 -1 will_delete
1580000000005  1 will_update_old
1580000000007 -1 will_update_old
1580000000007  1 will_update_new
````

This represents:

- Inserting `insert_key`.
- Inserting and then deleting `will_delete`.
- Inserting `will_update_old`, and then updating it to `will_update_new`

If you want to see the updates that had occurred in the last 30 seconds, you could run:

```sql
TAIL some_materialized_view AS OF now() - '30s'::INTERVAL
```

If you want timestamp completion messages:

```sql
COPY (TAIL some_materialized_view WITH (PROGRESS)) TO STDOUT
```
```
1580000000000 f  1 insert_key
1580000000001 t \N \N
1580000000001 f  1 will_delete
1580000000003 f -1 will_delete
1580000000005 t \N \N
1580000000005 f  1 will_update_old
1580000000006 t \N \N
1580000000007 t \N \N
1580000000007 f -1 will_update_old
1580000000007 f  1 will_update_new
1580000000009 t \N \N
````
