`timestamp` and `timestamp with time zone` data expresses a date and time in
UTC.

**OID** | 1083
**Min value** | 4713 BC
**Max value** | 294276 AD
**Resolution** | 1 microsecond / 14 digits

## `timestamp with time zone` info

Detail | Info
-------|------

## Syntax

Field | Use
------|-----
**WITH TIME ZONE** | Apply the _tz&lowbar;offset_ field. If not specified, don't.
**TIMESTAMPTZ** | Apply the _tz&lowbar;offset_ field.
_date&lowbar;str_ | _date&lowbar;str_ | A string representing a date in `Y-M-D`, `Y M-D`, `Y M D` or `YMD` format.
_time&lowbar;str_ | A string representing a time of day in `H:M:S.NS` format.
_tz&lowbar;offset_ | The timezone's distance, in hours, from UTC.

## Details

- `timestamp` and `timestamp with time zone` store data in
  [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).
- The difference between the two types is that `timestamp with time zone` can read or write
  timestamps with the offset specified by the timezone. Importantly,
  `timestamp with time zone` itself doesn't store any timezone data; Materialize simply
  performs the conversion from the time provided and UTC.
- Materialize assumes all clients expect UTC time, and does not currently
  support any other timezones.

### Valid casts

In addition to the casts listed below, `timestamp` and `timestamptz` can be cast to and from each other implicitly.

#### From `timestamp` or `timestamptz`

You can [cast](../../functions/cast) `timestamp` or `timestamptz` to:

- [`date`](../date) (by assignment)
- [`text`](../text) (by assignment)

#### To `timestamp` or `timestamptz`

You can [cast](../../functions/cast) the following types to `timestamp` or `timestamptz`:

- [`date`](../date) (implicitly)
- [`text`](../text) (explicitly)

### Valid operations

`timestamp` and `timestamp with time zone` data (collectively referred to as
`timestamp/tz`) supports the following operations with other types.

Operation | Computes
----------|------------
[`date`](../date) `+` [`interval`](../interval) | [`timestamp/tz`](../timestamp)
[`date`](../date) `-` [`interval`](../interval) | [`timestamp/tz`](../timestamp)
[`date`](../date) `+` [`time`](../time) | [`timestamp/tz`](../timestamp)
[`timestamp/tz`](../timestamp) `+` [`interval`](../interval) | [`timestamp/tz`](../timestamp)
[`timestamp/tz`](../timestamp) `-` [`interval`](../interval) | [`timestamp/tz`](../timestamp)
[`timestamp/tz`](../timestamp) `-` [`timestamp/tz`](../timestamp) | [`interval`](../interval)

## Examples

### Return timestamp

```sql
SELECT TIMESTAMP '2007-02-01 15:04:05' AS ts_v;
```
```nofmt
        ts_v
---------------------
 2007-02-01 15:04:05
```

### Return timestamp with time zone

```sql
SELECT TIMESTAMPTZ '2007-02-01 15:04:05+06' AS tstz_v;
```
```nofmt
         tstz_v
-------------------------
 2007-02-01 09:04:05 UTC
```
