## Getting Help with Materialize

Whether you're building, scaling, or debugging, we're here to help. 

{{< note >}}
We’re retiring access to Slack and Microsoft Teams workspaces. We’ve introduced the messenger app to streamline and scale how users engage with support — starting with AI-first assistance and seamless escalation paths when needed.

### Materialize Support

We offer multiple support pathways depending on your platform and plan:

**Messenger App**

You can reach us directly from:
- **materialize.com**
- **Materialize Console** (for Cloud customers)

Our messenger now features Matty, our AI-powered support agent. Matty can help answer questions, suggest documentation, and assist with troubleshooting. If your issue requires human assistance, you can request to “Talk to a human” at any time. Just look for the messenger widget on the bottom right.

**Email**

You can also email us your questions at support@materialize.com. 

**Join the Materialize Slack community**

Connect with other users, share ideas, and get informal help from the [Materialize user community](https://materialize.com/s/chat) on Slack.

**For SLA Supported Customers Only:** 

If you're experiencing an urgent issue, use the messenger’s “Report Production Outage” option for fastest response. 

Alternatively, you can email us (using your Materialize login email address). To ensure priority handling, include “urgent” in the subject line.

Use the following definitions to determine what priority to assign to
your support ticket:

<table style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Priority</th>
        <th style="min-width: 150px">Response time</th>
        <th>Definition</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Urgent</td>
        <td>Refer to your support contract</td>
        <td>
            <strong>Critical severity error:</strong> an Error in the Platform that: (a) renders the Platform completely inoperative, or (b) makes Customer’s use of material features of the Platform impossible, with no alternative available.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>High</td>
        <td>Refer to your support contract</td>
        <td>
            <strong>High severity error:</strong> an Error in the Platform that (a) has a high impact to key portions of the Platform, or (b) seriously impairs Customer’s use of material features of the Platform and Customer cannot reasonably circumvent or avoid the Error on a temporary basis without the expenditure of significant time or effort.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Normal</td>
        <td>Refer to your support contract</td>
        <td>
            <strong>Medium severity error:</strong> an Error that has a medium-to-low impact on the Platform, but Customer can still access and use some functionality of the Platform.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Low</td>
        <td>Refer to your support contract</td>
        <td>
            <strong>Low severity error:</strong> an Error that has low-to-no impact on Customer’s access to and use of the Platform.
        </td>
    </tr>
