## Getting help

If you run into a snag or need support during the trial period, join the [Materialize Slack community](https://materialize.com/s/chat) or [open an issue](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/new/choose). Slack is the best place to get timely help from Materialize employees and other users!

If you're a paying customer, you can also refer to our [customer support portal](https://support.materialize.com/).

## Checking service status

Check the current status of our services on the [status page](https://status.materialize.com), where we announce both planned and unplanned maintenance windows. You can also use the [status page API](https://status.materialize.com/api) to programmatically access the information on the status page.
