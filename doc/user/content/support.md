## Getting help

### Trials

If you run into a snag or need support during the trial period, join the [Materialize Slack community](https://materialize.com/s/chat) or [open a discussion](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/discussions). Slack is the best place to get timely help from Materialize employees and other users!

### Customers

If you're a paying customer, you can access Materialize support via a shared
channel within your company's Slack or Microsoft Teams workspace.

To file a support ticket:

1. Send a message to the shared channel describing your issue.
2. Apply the `:ticket:` (ðŸŽ«) emoji to your message.
3. Click the **File a ticket** button that appears.
4. Select the priority that corresponds to the severity of the issue you are
   experiencing. Consult the table below for definitions of error severities.
5. Materialize will respond to the ticket within the response time specified
   in your support contract.

{{< note >}}
Materialize only guarantees response times if you follow the above steps to
convert a message into a support ticket.

Use the following definitions to determine what priority to assign to
your support ticket:

        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>Refer to your support contract</td>
        <td>
            <strong>High severity error:</strong> an Error in the Platform thatÂ (a) has a high impact to key portions of the Platform, or (b) seriously impairs Customerâ€™s use of material features of the Platform and Customer cannot reasonably circumvent or avoid the Error on a temporary basis without the expenditure of significant time or effort.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Normal</td>
        <td>Refer to your support contract</td>
        <td>
            <strong>Medium severity error:</strong> an Error that has a medium-to-low impact on the Platform, but Customer can still access and use some functionality of the Platform.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Low</td>
        <td>Refer to your support contract</td>
        <td>
