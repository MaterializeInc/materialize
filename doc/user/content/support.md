If you're using the Source-Available version of Materialize, the best place to get help and support from Materialize employees and other users is the [Materialize Community](https://materialize.com/s/chat).

If you're already a paying customer, refer to our [customer support portal](https://support.materialize.com/).

Check the current status of our services on our [status page](https://status.materialize.com). We announce both planned and unplanned maintenance windows.

You can also use our [status page API](https://status.materialize.com/api) to
programmatically access the information on our status page.
