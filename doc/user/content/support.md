Whether you're building, scaling, or debugging, we're here to help.

{{< note >}}
We're retiring access to Slack and Microsoft Teams workspaces. We've introduced the messenger app to streamline and scale how users engage with support — starting with AI-first assistance and seamless escalation paths when needed.

## Materialize Support

We offer multiple support pathways depending on your platform and plan:

### Messenger App

You can reach us directly from:

- **materialize.com**

Our messenger now features Matty, our AI-powered support agent. Matty can help
answer questions, suggest documentation, and assist with troubleshooting. You
can also submit a request to **Talk to a human**. Just look for the messenger
widget on the bottom right.

{{< tip >}}
If you are an Enterprise customer with SLA support and are experiencing an
**urgent** issue, you can use the [**Report Production
Outage**](#report-production-outage-for-sla-supported-customers-only) option for
fastest response.
{{</ tip >}}

### Email

You can also email us your questions at `support@materialize.com` from your
Materialize login email address.

### Join the Materialize Slack community

Connect with other users, share ideas, and get informal help from the [Materialize user community](https://materialize.com/s/chat) on Slack.

## Report Production Outage (For SLA Supported Customers Only)

If you are an SLA Supported Enterprise Customer who is experiencing an
**urgent** issue,

- *Recommended*. Use the [messenger's **Report Production
  Outage** option](#messenger-app) for fastest response.

- Alternatively, you can email `support@materialize.com` from your Materialize
  login email address. To ensure priority handling, include **urgent** in the
  subject line.

Use the following definitions to determine what priority to assign to
your support ticket:

<table style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Priority</th>
        <th style="min-width: 150px">Response time</th>
        <th>Definition</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Urgent</td>
        <td>Refer to your support contract</td>
        <td>
            <strong>Critical severity error:</strong> an Error in the Platform that: (a) renders the Platform completely inoperative, or (b) makes Customer's use of material features of the Platform impossible, with no alternative available.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>High</td>
        <td>Refer to your support contract</td>
        <td>
            <strong>High severity error:</strong> an Error in the Platform that (a) has a high impact to key portions of the Platform, or (b) seriously impairs Customer's use of material features of the Platform and Customer cannot reasonably circumvent or avoid the Error on a temporary basis without the expenditure of significant time or effort.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Normal</td>
        <td>Refer to your support contract</td>
        <td>
            <strong>Medium severity error:</strong> an Error that has a medium-to-low impact on the Platform, but Customer can still access and use some functionality of the Platform.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Low</td>
        <td>Refer to your support contract</td>
        <td>
            <strong>Low severity error:</strong> an Error that has low-to-no impact on Customer's access to and use of the Platform.
        </td>
    </tr>
