[Debezium](https://debezium.io/) works with Materialize in two capacities:

- Debezium adds change data capture (CDC) to MySQL or PostgreSQL databases,
  which lets you propagate data from your database to Materialize.
- Debezium's CDC data (known as its envelope) is formatted in a way that
  expresses arbitrary operations (e.g. updates and deletes) on the database's
  data. This envelope is a powerful feature that lets Materialize perform more
  complex analysis by understanding how upstream data is changing.

For the best experience using Debezium, we recommend following the guidelines
outlined here.

### PostgreSQL settings

Materialize relies on Debezium's CDC envelope (which expresses changes to data)
to understand all CRUD-like operations happening in the upstream database.

For Debezium to emit the envelope Materialize expects when using PostgreSQL, the
tables which you're performing CDC on must have the parameter `REPLICA IDENTITY
FULL` set.

For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE foo
REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```

### Kafka-less setup

If you need to connect Materialize to a PostgreSQL database but Kafka is not part of your stack, you can use the [PostgreSQL direct source](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/postgres/#postgresql-source-details). This source uses PostgreSQLâ€™s native replication protocol to continuously propagate upstream changes into Materialize, bypassing the need to deploy and maintain a Kafka instance. For more details and step-by-step instructions, check the [documentation](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/postgres/#postgresql-source-details).
