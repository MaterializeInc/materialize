You can use [Debezium](https://debezium.io/) to propagate Change Data Capture (CDC) data from a database to Materialize, for example MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Debezium emits records using an envelope that contains valuable information about the change captured, like the `before` and `after` values for each record. This envelope is a powerful structure that lets Materialize perform more complex analysis to understand all CRUD-like operations happening in the upstream database. For more details on CDC support in Materialize, check the [documentation](/sql/create-source/avro-kafka/#debezium-envelope-details).


{{< note >}}
Currently, Materialize only supports Avro-encoded Debezium records. If you're interested in JSON support, please reach out in the community Slack or leave a comment in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/5231).

### CDC guides

For the best CDC experience, we recommend following the step-by-step guides for each upstream database:

* [PostgreSQL](/guides/cdc-postgres/)

* [MySQL](/guides/cdc-mysql/)

### Kafka-less setup

If you need to connect Materialize to a PostgreSQL database but Kafka is not part of your stack, you can use the [PostgreSQL direct source](/sql/create-source/postgres). This source uses PostgreSQLâ€™s native replication protocol to continuously propagate upstream changes into Materialize, bypassing the need to deploy and maintain a Kafka instance. For more details and step-by-step instructions, check the [Change Data Capture (Postgres) guide](/guides/cdc-postgres/#direct-postgres-source).
