Debezium works with Materialize in two capacities:

- Debezium adds change data capture (CDC) to MySQL or PostgreSQL databases,
  which lets you propagate data from your database to Materialize
- Debezium's CDC data (known as its envelope) is formatted in a way that
  expresses arbitrary operations (e.g. updates and deletes) on the database's
  data. This envelope is a powerful feature that lets Materialize perform more
  complex analysis by understanding how upstream data is changing.

For the best experience using Debezium, we recommend following the guidelines
outlined here.

### PostgreSQL settings

Materialize relies on Debezium's CDC envelope (which expresses changes to data)
to understand all CRUD-like operations happening in the upstream database.

For Debezium to emit the envelope Materialize expects when using PostgreSQL, the
tables which you're performing CDC on must have the parameter `REPLICA IDENTITY
FULL` set.

For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE foo
REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```
