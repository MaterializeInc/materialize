|------|---------|---------|
| [metabase](/third-party/metabase) | Create business intelligence dashboards on top of your Materialize data | Running Metabase cleanly, without our forked changes, requires further [pgjdbc support](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/3727).


## Beta-level support

| Tool | Purpose | What's missing? |
|------|---------|---------|
| [dbt](/third-party/dbt)  | Create views and materialized views in your Materialize instance using dbt | Full `dbt-materialize` adapter support is a [work in progress](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/5462).
