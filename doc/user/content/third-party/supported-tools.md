## Production-level support

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Docker](/third-party/docker) | Easily deploy Materialize and other required infrastructure.
| [Debezium](/guides/cdc-postgres) | Propagate change data capture (CDC) data from an upstream database to Materialize.


## Beta-level support

Beta-level support means the integration with Materialize may have performance or stability issues and is not subject
to our [backwards compatibility](/versions/#backwards-compatibility)
guarantee.

| Tool                    | Purpose                                                                    | What's missing?                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [dbt](/third-party/dbt) | Create views and materialized views in your Materialize instance using dbt | Full `dbt-materialize` adapter support is a [work in progress](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/5462). |
| [Redpanda](/third-party/redpanda) | Set up Redpanda as a data source. | Kafka offsets are ignored.

## Alpha-level support

Alpha-level support means that some of our community members have made this integration work, but that we haven't tested it ourselves and can't guarantee its stability.

| Tool | Purpose | What's missing? |
|------|---------|---------|
| [Metabase](/third-party/metabase) | Create business intelligence dashboards on top of your Materialize data | Running Metabase cleanly, without our forked changes, requires further [pgjdbc support](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/3727).
