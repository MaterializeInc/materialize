## Top K using a `LATERAL` subquery and `LIMIT`

Suppose you want to group rows in a table by some key, then filter out all but
the first _K_ elements within each group according to some ordering. In other
databases, you might use window functions. In Materialize, we recommend using a
[`LATERAL` subquery](/transform-data/join/#lateral-subqueries). The general form of the
query looks like this:

```mzsql
SELECT key_col, ... FROM
    (SELECT DISTINCT key_col FROM tbl) grp,
    LATERAL (
        SELECT col1, col2..., order_col
        FROM tbl
        WHERE key_col = grp.key_col
        ORDER BY order_col LIMIT k
    )
ORDER BY key_col, order_col
```

For example, suppose you have a relation containing the population of various
U.S. cities.

```mzsql
CREATE TABLE cities (
    city text NOT NULL,
    state text NOT NULL,
    pop int NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO cities VALUES
    ('Los_Angeles', 'CA', 3979576),
    ('Phoenix', 'AZ', 1680992),
    ('Houston', 'TX', 2320268),
    ('San_Diego', 'CA', 1423851),
    ('San_Francisco', 'CA', 881549),
    ('New_York', 'NY', 8336817),
    ('Dallas', 'TX', 1343573),
    ('San_Antonio', 'TX', 1547253),
    ('San_Jose', 'CA', 1021795),
    ('Chicago', 'IL', 2695598),
    ('Austin', 'TX', 978908);
```

To fetch the three most populous cities in each state:

```mzsql
SELECT state, city FROM
    (SELECT DISTINCT state FROM cities) grp,
    LATERAL (
        SELECT city, pop
        FROM cities
        WHERE state = grp.state
        ORDER BY pop DESC LIMIT 3
    )
ORDER BY state, pop DESC;
```

The query returns the following results:

| state | city        |
| ----- | ----------- |
| AZ    | Phoenix     |
| CA    | Los_Angeles |
| CA    | San_Diego   |
| CA    | San_Jose    |
| IL    | Chicago     |
| NY    | New_York    |
| TX    | Houston     |
| TX    | San_Antonio |
| TX    | Dallas      |

Despite the verbosity of the above query, Materialize produces a straightforward
plan:

```mzsql
EXPLAIN SELECT state, city FROM ...
```

The explain returns the following:

```nofmt
Explained Query:
  Finish order_by=[#0{state} asc nulls_last, #2{pop} desc nulls_first] output=[#0..=#2]
    TopK group_by=[#0{state}] order_by=[#2{pop} desc nulls_first] limit=3 // { arity: 3 }
      Project (#1{city}, #0{state}, #2{pop}) // { arity: 3 }
        ReadStorage materialize.public.cities // { arity: 3 }
```

## Top 1 using `DISTINCT ON`

If _K_ = 1, i.e., you would like to see only the most populous city in each state, another approach is to use `DISTINCT ON`:

```mzsql
SELECT DISTINCT ON(state) state, city
FROM cities
ORDER BY state, pop DESC;
```
Note that the `ORDER BY` clause should start with the expressions that are in the `DISTINCT ON`.

## Group size hints

When using either the above `LATERAL` subquery pattern or `DISTINCT ON`, we recommend
specifying [query hints](/sql/select/#query-hints) to improve memory usage. For example:

```mzsql
SELECT state, city FROM
    (SELECT DISTINCT state FROM cities) grp,
    LATERAL (
        SELECT city, pop
        FROM cities
        WHERE state = grp.state
        OPTIONS (LIMIT INPUT GROUP SIZE = 1000)
        ORDER BY pop DESC LIMIT 3
    )
ORDER BY state, pop DESC;
```

or

```mzsql
SELECT DISTINCT ON(state) state, city
FROM cities
OPTIONS (DISTINCT ON INPUT GROUP SIZE = 1000)
ORDER BY state, pop DESC;
```

To learn more about how to set the values for the query hints above, see the [Optimization](/transform-data/optimization/#query-hints) page.
