## Stable releases

Binary tarballs for all stable releases are provided below. Other installation
options are available for the latest stable release on the [Install
page](/install).

{{< version-list >}}

Binary tarballs require a recent version of their stated platform:

* macOS binary tarballs require macOS 10.14 and later.
* Linux binary tarballs require a glibc-based Linux distribution whose kernel
  and glibc versions are compatible with Ubuntu Xenial. Glibc-based Linux
  distributions released mid-2016 or later are likely to be compatible.

## Unstable builds

Binary tarballs are built for every merge to the [main branch on
GitHub][github]. These tarballs are not suitable for use in production.
**Run unstable builds at your own risk.**
