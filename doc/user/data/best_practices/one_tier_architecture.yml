    Description: |
      **A cluster** for [sources](/concepts/sources/), compute/transformation
      and serving queries:

      - Sources to ingest data.

      - Views that define the transformations.

      - Indexes on views to maintain up-to-date results in memory and serve queries.

      With a 1-tier single-cluster architecture, sources, compute, and queries
      compete for the same cluster resources.
