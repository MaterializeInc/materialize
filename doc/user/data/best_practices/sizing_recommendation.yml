rows:
  - Field: "**workers**"
    Type: int
    Description: |

      The number of timely workers in your cluster replica.

    Recommendation: |

      Use 1 worker per CPU core, with a minimum of 1 worker.

  - Field: "**scale**"
    Type: int
    Description: |

      The number of pods (i.e., processes) to use in a cluster replica; used to
      scale out replicas horizontally. Each pod will be provisioned using the
      settings defined in the size definition.

    Recommendation: |

      Generally, this should be set to 1. This should only be greater than 1 when a replica needs to take on limits that are greater than the maximum limits permitted on a single node.

  - Field: "**cpu_exclusive**"
    Type: bool
    Description: |

      The flag that determines if the workers should attempt to pin to a particular CPU core.
    Recommendation: |

      <a name="cpu_exclusive"></a>

      Set to true **if and only if** the [`cpu_limit`](#cpu_limit) is a whole
      number and the CPU management policy in the k8s cluster is set to static.

  - Field: "**cpu_limit**"
    Type: float
    Description: |

      <a name="cpu_limit"></a>
      The k8s limit for CPU for a replica pod in cores.
    Recommendation: |

      Prefer whole number values to enable CPU affinity. Kubernetes only allows
      CPU Affinity for pods taking a whole number of cores.

      If the value is not a whole number, set [`cpu_exclusive`](#cpu_exclusive) to false.

  - Field: "**memory_limit**"
    Type: float
    Description: |

      The k8s limit for memory for a replica pod in bytes.
    Recommendation: |

      For most workloads, use an approximate **1:8** CPU-to-memory ratio (1 core
      : 8 GiB). This can vary depending on your workload characteristics.

  - Field: "**disk_limit**"
    Type: float
    Description: |

      The size of the NVMe persistent volume to provision for a replica pod in bytes.
    Recommendation: |

      When spill-to-disk is enabled, use a **1:2** memory-to-disk ratio. Materialize spills data to disk when memory is insufficient, which can impact performance.

  - Field: "**credits_per_hour**"
    Type: string
    Description: |

      This is a cloud attribute that should be set to "0.00" in self-managed.
    Recommendation: |

      Set to "0.00" for self-managed deployments.

  - Field: "**selectors**"
    Type: map
    Description: |

      This is a map of selector keys to values that will be used to schedule pods for this cluster on specific nodes.
    Recommendation: |

      It is generally not required to set this.
