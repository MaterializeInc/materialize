      **A dedicated cluster(s)** for [sources](/concepts/sources/).

  - "Tier": "**Compute/Transform + Serving cluster**"
    Description: |
      **A dedicated cluster** for both compute/transformation and serving queries:

      - [Views](/concepts/views/#views) that define the
        transformations.

      - Indexes on views to maintain up-to-date results in memory and serve
      queries.

      With a two-tier architecture, compute and queries compete for the same
      cluster resources.

      {{< include-md file="shared-content/shared-cluster-indexed-view-tip.md" >}}

      **Additional Considerations:**

      - Clusters containing [sinks](/serve-results/sink/) can only have a
      replication factor of `1` (or `0`).
