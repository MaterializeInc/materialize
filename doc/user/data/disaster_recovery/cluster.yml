      Time to spin up new machine + possible rehydration time, depending on the
      objects on the machine:

      - If sources, no additional time (i.e., does not require rehydration).
      - If sinks, no additional time (i.e., does not require rehydration).
      - If compute, rehydration time.
      - If serving, rehydration time.

      To reduce rehydration time, scale up the cluster.
    RTO (RF2 - multiple AZs): |
      Can be:

      - 0 if only compute and serving objects are on the machine.

      - Time to spin up new machine if sources or sinks are on the machine.

      In addition, cluster RTO is affected if the [`environmentd` is
      down](#environmentd) (seconds to minutes).

      *For managed clusters*

      Time to spin up new machine + possible rehydration time, depending on the
      objects on the machine:

      - If non-upsert sources, no rehydration time(i.e., does not require
        rehydration).
      - If upsert sources, rehydration time.
      - If sinks, no rehydration time (i.e., does not require rehydration).
      - If compute, rehydration time.
      - If serving, rehydration time.

      Additionally, sources may require time to catch up with changes in the
      upstream system.

      To reduce rehydration time, you can scale up the cluster.

      During downtime, single AZ PrivateLinks are impacted.
    RTO (RF2 - multiple AZs): |

      Can be:

      - 0 if only compute and serving objects are on the machine.

      - Time to spin up new machine if sources or sinks are on the machine.

      In addition, cluster RTO is affected if the [`environmentd` is
      down](#environmentd) (seconds to minutes).

  - Failure Type: "**Regional failure (or 2 AZs failures)**"
    RPO: |
      At most, 1 hour (time since last backup, based on hourly backups).<br>

    RTO (RF1 - single AZ): |
      ~1 hour (time to check pointers).
    RTO (RF2 - multiple AZs): |
      High/Significant. Consider using a [regional failover strategy](/manage/disaster-recovery/#level-3-a-duplicate-materialize-environment-inter-region-resilience).
