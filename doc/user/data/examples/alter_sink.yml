    That is, assume you have a Kafka sink `avro_sink` created from `matview_old`
    (See [`CREATE SINK`:Kafka/Redpanda](/sql/create-sink/kafka/) for more
    information):
  code: |
    CREATE SINK avro_sink
      FROM matview_old
      INTO KAFKA CONNECTION kafka_connection (TOPIC 'test_avro_topic')
      KEY (key_col)
      FORMAT AVRO USING CONFLUENT SCHEMA REGISTRY CONNECTION csr_connection
      ENVELOPE UPSERT

    To have the sink read from `matview_new` instead of `matview_old`, you can
    use `ALTER SINK` to change the `FROM <relation>`:

    {{< note >}}
    `matview_new` must be compatible with the previously published
    schema. Otherwise, the `ALTER SINK` command will succeed, but the
    subsequent execution of the sink will result in errors and will not be able
    to make progress. See [Valid schema changes](#valid-schema-changes) for
    details.
    {{< /note >}}
  code: |
    ALTER SINK avro_sink
      SET FROM matview_new
    ;
  results: |

    {{< tip >}}

    Because Materialize emits updates from the newly specified relation **only** if
    they happen after the cutover timestamp, you might observe the following
    scenarios:
    - [Topic contains stale value for a
      key](#scenario-1-topic-contains-stale-value-for-a-key)
    - [Topic is missing a key that exists in the new relation](#scenario-2-topic-is-missing-a-key-that-exists-in-the-new-relation)
    - [Topic contains a key that does not exist in the new relation](#scenario-3-topic-contains-a-key-that-does-not-exist-in-the-new-relation)

    For workaround, see [Example: Handle cutover scenarios](#handle-cutover-scenarios)

    - [Topic contains a key that does not exist in the new relation](#scenario-3-topic-contains-a-key-that-does-not-exist-in-the-new-relation)

    To handle these scenarios, you can first alter sink to an intermediary
    materialized view. The intermediary materialized view uses a temporary table
    `switch` that switches the view's contents from old relation content to new
    relation content. At the time of the switch, Materialize emits the diff of
    the changes. Then, after the sink upper has advanced beyond the time of the
    switch, you can `ALTER SINK` to the new relation (and remove the temporary
    intermediary materialized view and table).

    For example, create a table `switch` and a temporary materialized view
    `transition` that contains either:
    - the `matview_old` content if `switch.value` is `false`.
    - the `matview_new` content if `switch.value` is `true`.

    At first, the `switch.value` is `false`, so the `transition` materialized view contains the `matview_old` content.
- name: "handle-cutover-scenarios-create-transition-mv"
  code: |
    CREATE TABLE switch (value bool);
    INSERT INTO switch VALUES (false); -- controls whether we want the new or the old materialized view.

    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW transition AS
    (SELECT matview_old.* FROM matview_old JOIN switch ON switch.value = false)
    UNION ALL
    (SELECT matview_new.* FROM matview_new JOIN switch ON switch.value = true)
    ;

    Update `switch.value` to `true`, which causes the `transition` materialized view to contain `matview_new` content:

    Wait for the sink's upper frontier to advance beyond the time of the switch update. Once
    advanced, alter sink to use `matview_new`:
- name: "handle-cutover-scenarios-alter-sink-to-new-mv"
  code: |
    -- After sink upper has advanced beyond the time of the switch UPDATE.
    ALTER SINK avro_sink SET FROM matview_new;
