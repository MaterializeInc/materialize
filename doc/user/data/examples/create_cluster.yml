      description: |
        Optional. Whether to automatically manage the cluster's replicas based on the
        configured size and replication factor.

        Specify `FALSE` to create an **unmanaged** cluster. With unmanaged
        clusters, you need to manually manage the cluster's replicas using the
        the [`CREATE CLUSTER REPLICA`](/sql/create-cluster-replica) and [`DROP
        CLUSTER REPLICA`](/sql/drop-cluster-replica) commands. When creating an
        unmanaged cluster, you must specify the `REPLICAS` option as well.

        {{< tip >}}
        When getting started with Materialize, we recommend starting with managed
        clusters.

        Default: `TRUE`
    - name: "`SCHEDULE`"
      description: |
        Optional. The [scheduling type](#scheduling) for the cluster.
        Valid values are:
        - `MANUAL`
        - `ON REFRESH`

        Default: `MANUAL`
