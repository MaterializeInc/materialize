    To create a source from an external MySQL:
  code: |
    CREATE SOURCE [IF NOT EXISTS] <source_name>
    [IN CLUSTER <cluster_name>]
    FROM MYSQL CONNECTION <connection_name>
    ;
- name: "syntax-options"

    {{% yaml-table data="syntax_options/create_source/create_source_options_mysql" %}}
- name: "create-source"
  description: |
    Once you have configured the upstream MySQL, network security, and
    created the connection, you can create the source. In this example, the connection to MySQL is
    `mysql_connection`.

  code: |
    CREATE SOURCE mysql_source
    FROM MYSQL CONNECTION mysql_connection;

    After a source is created, you can reference specific replicatedtable(s)
    from the source create tables in Materialize.
  code: |
    CREATE TABLE items
    FROM SOURCE mysql_source(REFERENCE public.items)
    ;
    CREATE TABLE orders
    FROM SOURCE mysql_source(REFERENCE public.orders)
    ;
