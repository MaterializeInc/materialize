    To create a source from an external PostgreSQL:

  code: |
    CREATE SOURCE [IF NOT EXISTS] <source_name>
    [IN CLUSTER <cluster_name>]
    FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION <connection_name> (PUBLICATION '<publication_name>')
    ;
- name: "syntax-options"
  description: |
    {{% yaml-table data="syntax_options/create_source/create_source_options_postgres" %}}
- name: "create-source"
  description: |

    Once you have configured the upstream PostgreSQL, network security, and
    created the connection, you can create the source. In this example, the
    PostgreSQL publication is `mz_source` and the connection to PostgreSQL is
    `pg_connection`.

  code: |
    CREATE SOURCE pg_source
    FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION pg_connection (
      PUBLICATION 'mz_source'
    );

    After a source is created, you can reference specific replicatedtable(s)
    from the source create tables in Materialize.
  code: |
    CREATE TABLE items
    FROM SOURCE pg_source(REFERENCE public.items)
    ;
  results: |

    See [`CREATE TABLE`](/sql/create-table/postgres/) for more details.
