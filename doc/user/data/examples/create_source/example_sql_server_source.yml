    To create a source from an external SQL Server:
  code: |
    CREATE SOURCE [IF NOT EXISTS] <source_name>
    [IN CLUSTER <cluster_name>]
    FROM SQL SERVER CONNECTION <connection_name>
    ;

- name: "create-source"

    Once you have configured the upstream SQL Server, network security, and
    created the connection, you can create the source. In this example, the
    connection to SQL Server is `sql_server_connection`.
  code: |
    CREATE SOURCE sql_server_source
    FROM SQL SERVER CONNECTION sql_server_connection
    ;

    After a source is created, you can reference specific replicated table(s)
    from the source create tables in Materialize.
  code: |
    CREATE TABLE items
    FROM SOURCE sql_server_source(REFERENCE sales.items)
