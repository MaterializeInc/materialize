    Once you have created the connection, you can use the connection in the
    [`CREATE SOURCE`](/sql/create-source/) command to connect to your MySQL instance and start ingesting
    data:
  code: |
    CREATE SOURCE mz_source
      FROM MYSQL CONNECTION mysql_connection
      FOR ALL TABLES;

    - By default, the source will be created in the active cluster; to use a different cluster, use the `IN CLUSTER` clause.

    - To ingest data from specific schemas or tables, use the `FOR SCHEMAS (<schema1>,<schema2>)` or `FOR TABLES (<table1>, <table2>)` options instead of `FOR ALL TABLES`.

    - To handle [unsupported data types](#supported-types), use the `TEXT COLUMNS` or `EXCLUDE COLUMNS` options.

    After source creation, refer to [schema changes
    considerations](#schema-changes) for information on handling upstream schema changes.
