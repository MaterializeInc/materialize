    - Replace `<host>` with the **Writer** endpoint for your Aurora database. To
      find the endpoint, select your database in the AWS Management Console,
      then click the **Connectivity & security** tab and look for the endpoint
      with type **Writer**.

        <div class="warning">
            <strong class="gutter">WARNING!</strong>
            You must use the <strong>Writer</strong> endpoint for the database. Using a <strong>Reader</strong> endpoint will not work.
        </div>

      you want to replicate to Materialize.
