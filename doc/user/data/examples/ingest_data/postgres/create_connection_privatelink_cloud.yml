    In the [Materialize Console's SQL Shell](/console/), or your preferred SQL
    client connected to Materialize, use the [`CREATE
    CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/#aws-privatelink) command to create an
    AWS PrivateLink connection:
  code: |
    CREATE CONNECTION privatelink_svc TO AWS PRIVATELINK (
      SERVICE NAME 'com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0356210a8a432d9e9',
      AVAILABILITY ZONES ('use1-az1', 'use1-az2', 'use1-az4')
    );
- name: "create-privatelink-connection-options-aurora"
  description: |
    - Replace the `SERVICE NAME` value with the service name you noted
    [earlier](#b-optional-configure-network-security).

    - Replace the `AVAILABILITY ZONES` list with the IDs of the availability
      zones in your AWS account.

      To find your availability zone IDs, select your database in the RDS
      Console and click the subnets under **Connectivity & security**. For each
      subnet, look for **Availability Zone ID** (e.g., `use1-az6`),
      not **Availability Zone** (e.g., `us-east-1d`).

    In the [SQL Shell](https://console.materialize.com/), or your preferred SQL
    client connected to Materialize, use the [`CREATE
    CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/#aws-privatelink) command to create an
    **in-region** or **cross-region** AWS PrivateLink connection.
- name: "create-privatelink-connection-rds-in-region"
  description: |-
    ↕️ **In-region connections**

    To connect to an AWS PrivateLink endpoint service in the **same region** as
    your Materialize environment:

  code: |
    CREATE CONNECTION privatelink_svc TO AWS PRIVATELINK ( SERVICE
          NAME 'com.amazonaws.vpce.<region_id>.vpce-svc-<endpoint_service_id>',
          AVAILABILITY ZONES ('use1-az1', 'use1-az2', 'use1-az4') );

- name: "create-privatelink-connection-rds-in-region-options"
  description: |
    - Replace the `SERVICE NAME` value with the service name you noted
    [earlier](#b-optional-configure-network-security).

    - Replace the `AVAILABILITY ZONES` list with the IDs of the availability
    zones in your AWS account. For in-region connections the availability zones
    of the NLB and the consumer VPC **must match**.

      To find your availability zone IDs, select your database in the RDS
      Console and click the subnets under **Connectivity & security**. For each
      subnet, look for **Availability Zone ID** (e.g., `use1-az6`), not
      **Availability Zone** (e.g., `us-east-1d`).

    ↔️ **Cross-region connections**

    To connect to an AWS PrivateLink endpoint service in a **different region**
    to the one where your Materialize environment is deployed:
  code: |
    CREATE CONNECTION privatelink_svc TO AWS PRIVATELINK ( SERVICE
    NAME 'com.amazonaws.vpce.us-west-1.vpce-svc-<endpoint_service_id>', -- For
    now, the AVAILABILITY ZONES clause **is** required, but will be -- made
    optional in a future release. AVAILABILITY ZONES () );

- name: "create-privatelink-connection-rds-cross-region-options"
  description: |-
    - Replace the `SERVICE NAME` value with the service name you noted
    [earlier](#b-optional-configure-network-security).

    - The service name region refers to where the endpoint service was created.
    You **do not need** to specify `AVAILABILITY ZONES` manually — these will be
    optimally auto-assigned when none are provided.
