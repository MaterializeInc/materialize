    Once you have created the connection, you can use the connection in the
    [`CREATE SOURCE`](/sql/create-source/) command to connect to your PostgreSQL
    instance and start ingesting data from the publication you created
    [earlier](#2-create-a-publication-and-a-replication-user):

  code: |
    CREATE SOURCE mz_source
      IN CLUSTER ingest_postgres
      FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION pg_connection (PUBLICATION 'mz_source')
      FOR ALL TABLES;

    - By default, the source will be created in the active cluster; to use a different cluster, use the `IN CLUSTER` clause.
    - To ingest data from specific schemas or tables, use the `FOR SCHEMAS (<schema1>,<schema2>)` or `FOR TABLES (<table1>, <table2>)` options instead of `FOR ALL TABLES`.
    - To handle [unsupported data types](#supported-types), use the `TEXT COLUMNS` or `EXCLUDE COLUMNS` options.

    After source creation, refer to [schema changes
    considerations](#schema-changes) for information on handling upstream schema changes.
