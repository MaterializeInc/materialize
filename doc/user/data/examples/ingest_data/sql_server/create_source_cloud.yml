    Use the [`CREATE SOURCE`](/sql/create-source/) command to connect
    Materialize to your SQL Server instance and start ingesting data:
  code: |
    CREATE SOURCE mz_source
      FROM SQL SERVER CONNECTION sqlserver_connection
      FOR ALL TABLES;

    - By default, the source will be created in the active cluster; to use a
      different cluster, use the `IN CLUSTER` clause.
    - To ingest data from specific tables use the `FOR TABLES
      (<table1>, <table2>)` options instead of `FOR ALL TABLES`.
    - To handle unsupported data types, use the `TEXT COLUMNS` or `EXCLUDE
      COLUMNS` options. Check out the [reference
      documentation](#supported-types) for guidance.

    After source creation, refer to [schema changes
    considerations](#schema-changes) for information on handling upstream schema changes.
