    - name: "`<table_name>`"
      description: |
        The table to write values to.
    - name: "`<col1> [, ...]`"
      description: |
        Correlates the inserted rows' columns to `<table_name>`'s columns by ordinal position, i.e. the first column of the row to insert is correlated to the first named column.

        If some but not all of `<table_name>`'s columns are provided, the unprovided columns receive their type's default value, or `NULL` if no default value was specified.
    - name: "`VALUES ( <expr1> [, ...] ) [, ...]`"
      description: |
        A list of tuples `( <expr1> [, ...] ) [, ...]` to insert. Each tuple contains expressions or values to be inserted into the columns. If a given column is nullable, a `NULL` value may be provided.
    - name: "`DEFAULT VALUES`"
      description: |
        Insert a single row using the default value for all columns.
    - name: "`<query>`"
      description: |
        A [`SELECT`](/sql/select) statement whose returned rows you want to write to the table.
    - name: "`RETURNING <output_expr | *> [, ...]`"
      description: |
        Causes `INSERT` to return values based on each inserted row:
        - `*` to return all columns
        - `<output_expr> [[AS] <alias>]`. [Aggregate functions](/sql/functions/#aggregate-functions) are not allowed in the `RETURNING` clause.
