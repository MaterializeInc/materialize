  description: |
     - Materialize Cloud does not support the `NOINHERIT` option for `CREATE
     ROLE`.
     - Materialize Cloud does not support the `LOGIN` and `SUPERUSER` attributes
       for `CREATE ROLE`.  See [Organization
       roles](/security/cloud/users-service-accounts/#organization-roles)
       instead.
     - Materialize Cloud does not use role attributes to determine a role's
     ability to create top level objects such as databases and other roles.
     Instead, Materialize uses system level privileges. See [GRANT
     PRIVILEGE](../grant-privilege) for more details.
