  description: |
     - Self-Managed Materialize does not support the `NOINHERIT` option for
     `CREATE ROLE`.
     - With the exception of the `SUPERUSER` attribute, Self-Managed Materialize
     does not use role attributes to determine a role's ability to create top
     level objects such as databases and other roles. Instead, Self-Managed
     Materialize uses system level privileges. See [GRANT PRIVILEGE](../grant-privilege) for more details.
