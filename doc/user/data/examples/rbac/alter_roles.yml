    The following example configures the `blue.berry@example.com` role to use
    the `compute_cluster` cluster, `mydb` database, and `sales` schema by
    default.

  code: |
    ALTER ROLE "blue.berry@example.com" SET CLUSTER = compute_cluster;
    ALTER ROLE "blue.berry@example.com" SET DATABASE = mydb;
    ALTER ROLE "blue.berry@example.com" SET search_path = sales; -- i.e., schema
  results: |

    - These changes will take effect in the next session for the role; the
      changes have **NO** effect on the current session.

    - These configurations are just the defaults. For example, the connection
      string can specify a different database for the session or the user can
      issue a `SET ...` command to override these values for the current
      session.

- name: "alter-roles-configs-not-inherited"
  description: |

    In Materialize, when you grant a role to another role (user role/service
    account role/independent role), the target role inherits only the privileges
    of the granted role. **Role configurations are not inherited.** For example,
    the following example updates the `data_reader` role to use
    `serving_cluster` by default.

  code: |
    ALTER ROLE data_reader SET CLUSTER = serving_cluster;
  results: |

    This change affects only the `data_reader` role and does not affect roles
    that have been granted `data_reader`, such as `sales_report_app`. That is,
    after this change:

    - The default cluster for `data_reader` is `serving_cluster` for new
      sessions.

    - The default cluster for `sales_report_app` is not affected.
