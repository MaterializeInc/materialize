      description: |
        An [`interval`](/sql/types/interval/) value to justify. Returns a new interval such that 30-day time periods are converted to months, 24-hour time periods are represented as days, and all fields have the same sign. It is a combination of [`justify_days`](/sql/functions/justify-days) and [`justify_hours`](/sql/functions/justify-hours) with additional sign adjustment.
