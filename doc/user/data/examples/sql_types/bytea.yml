      description: |
        An escape-formatted binary string. The string is preceded by `\`. Octet values can be escaped by converting them into their three-digit octal values and preceding them with backslashes; the backslash itself can be escaped as a double backslash. Certain values must be escaped: zero octet (`\000`), single quote (`\047` or `''''`), backslash (`\134` or `\\`), and non-printable octets (`\xxx` where `xxx` is the octal value).
