      description: |
        An escape string literal. Follows the same rules as standard string literals, except that backslash character (`\`) starts an escape sequence. The following escape sequences are recognized: `\b` (backspace), `\f` (form feed), `\n` (newline), `\r` (carriage return), `\t` (tab), `\uXXXX` or `\UXXXXXXXX` (Unicode codepoint), `\\` (literal backslash), `\'` (alternate means of escaping single quote).
