        A UUID string. The standard form consists of five groups of lowercase hexadecimal digits separated by hyphens: `8-4-4-4-12` digits. Materialize also accepts UUID input where hyphens are omitted, or where some or all hexadecimal digits are uppercase. Materialize will always output UUIDs in the standard form.
