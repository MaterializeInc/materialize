      Produces rows from either an existing relation (source/view/materialized view/table) or from a previous
      CTE in the same plan.
      There may be a `MapFilterProject` included in the lookup.

      There are three types of `Get`.

      1. `Get::PassArrangements`, which means the plan will use an
         existing [arrangement](/get-started/arrangements/#arrangements).

      2. `Get::Arrangement`, which means that the results will be
         _looked up_ in an existing arrangement.

      3. `Get::Collection`, which means that the results are
         unarranged, and will be processed as they arrive.

      rows. See also [column numbering](#explain-plan-columns).
    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: False
    expansive_details: |
      Each row has _less_ data (i.e., shorter rows, but same number of rows).

  - operator: MapFilterProject
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      The number after the operator is the input operator's `lir_id`.

      Computes new columns, filters columns, and projects away columns. Works row-by-row.
    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      Each row may have more data, from the `Map`.
      Each row may also have less data, from the `Project`.
      There may be fewer rows, from the `Filter`.

    example: "`MapFilterProject 5`"

  - operator: FlatMap
    plan_types: "optimized"
    description: |
      Appends the result of some (one-to-many) [table function](/sql/functions/#table-functions) to each row in the input.
    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: True

  - operator: ~Join
    plan_types: "raw"
    description: |
      Performs one of `INNER` / `LEFT` / `RIGHT` / `FULL OUTER` / `CROSS` join on the two inputs, using the given predicate.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory proportional to the input sizes, unless [the inputs have appropriate indexes](/transform-data/optimization/#join). Certain joins with more than 2 inputs use additional memory, see details in the optimized plan.
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      For `CrossJoin`s, Cartesian product of the inputs (|N| x |M|). Note that, in many cases, a join that shows up as a cross join in the RAW PLAN will actually be turned into an inner join in the OPTIMIZED PLAN, by making use of an equality WHERE condition.
      For other join types, depends on the join order and facts about the joined collections.
    example: "`InnerJoin (#0 = #2)`"

  - operator: Join
    plan_types: "optimized"
    description: |
      Returns combinations of rows from each input whenever some equality predicates are `true`.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      The `Join` operator itself uses memory only for `type=differential` with more than 2 inputs.
      However, `Join` operators need [arrangements](/get-started/arrangements/#arrangements) on their inputs (shown by the `ArrangeBy` operator).
      These arrangements use memory proportional to the input sizes. If an input has an [appropriate index](/transform-data/optimization/#join), then the arrangement of the index will be reused.
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      Depends on the join order and facts about the joined collections.
    example: "`Join on=(#1 = #2) type=delta`"

  - operator: Join::~
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      The input operators are listed in the order performed by the join.

      Returns combinations of rows from each input whenever some equality predicates are `true`.

      There are two types of `Join`: `Join::Differential` (also called linear join) and `Join::Delta`, with [documented differences](/transform-data/optimization/#join).
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory for 3-way or more differential joins.
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      Depends on the join order and facts about the joined collections.
    example: "`Join::Differential 6 » 7`"


  - operator: CrossJoin
    plan_types: "optimized"
    description: |
      An alias for a `Join` with an empty predicate (emits all combinations). Note that not all cross joins are marked
      as `CrossJoin`: In a join with more than 2 inputs, it can happen that there is a cross join between some of the inputs.
      You can recognize this case by `ArrangeBy` operators having empty keys, i.e., `ArrangeBy keys=[[]]`.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory for 3-way or more differential joins.
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      Cartesian product of the inputs (|N| x |M|).
    example: "`CrossJoin type=differential`"

  - operator: Reduce
    plan_types: "optimized"
    description: |
      Groups the input rows by some scalar expressions, reduces each group using some aggregate functions, and produces rows containing the group key and aggregate outputs.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      `SUM`, `COUNT`, and most other aggregations use a moderate amount of memory (proportional either to twice the output size or to input size + output size).
      `MIN` and `MAX` aggregates can use significantly more memory. This can be improved by including group size hints in the query, see
      [`mz_introspection.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_expected_group_size_advice).
    expansive: False
    example: "`Reduce group_by=[#0] aggregates=[max((#0 * #1))]`"

  - operator: Reduce::~
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      The number after the operator is the input operator's `lir_id`.

      Groups the input rows by some scalar expressions, reduces each group using some aggregate functions, and produces rows containing the group key and aggregate outputs.

      There are five types of `Reduce`, ordered by increasing complexity:

      1. `Reduce::Distinct` corresponds to the SQL `DISTINCT` operator.

      2. `Reduce::Accumulable` (e.g., `SUM`, `COUNT`) corresponds to several easy to implement aggregations that can be executed simultaneously and efficiently.

      3. `Reduce::Hierarchical` (e.g., `MIN`, `MAX`) corresponds to an aggregation requiring a tower of arrangements. These can be either monotonic (more efficient) or bucketed. These may benefit from a hint; [see `mz_introspection.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_expected_group_size_advice).

      4. `Reduce::Collation` corresponds to an arbitrary mix of reductions of different types, which will be performed separately and then joined together.

      5. `Reduce::Basic` (e.g., window functions, `list_agg`) corresponds to a single non-incremental aggregation.

    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      `Distinct` and `Accumulable` aggregates use a moderate amount of memory (proportional to twice the output size).
      `MIN` and `MAX` aggregates can use significantly more memory. This can be improved by including group size hints in the query, see
      [`mz_introspection.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_expected_group_size_advice).
      `Basic` aggregates use memory proportional to the input + output size.
      `Collation` aggregates use memory that is the sum of their constituents, plus some memory for the join at the end.
    expansive: False
    example: "`Reduce::Accumulable 8`"

  - operator: Reduce
    plan_types: "raw"
    description: |
      Groups the input rows by some scalar expressions, reduces each group using
      some aggregate functions, and produces rows containing the group key and
      aggregate outputs.  In the case where the group key is empty and the input
      is empty, returns a single row with the aggregate functions applied to the
      empty input collection.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      `SUM`, `COUNT`, and most other aggregations use a moderate amount of memory (proportional either to twice the output size or to input size + output size).
      `MIN` and `MAX` aggregates can use significantly more memory. This can be improved by including group size hints in the query, see
      [`mz_introspection.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_expected_group_size_advice).
    expansive: False
    example: "`Reduce group_by=[#0] aggregates=[max((#0 * #1))]`"

  - operator: Distinct
    plan_types: "optimized"
    description: |
      Alias for a `Reduce` with an empty aggregate list.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory proportional to twice the output size.
    expansive: False
    example: "`Distinct`"

  - operator: Distinct
    plan_types: "raw"
    description: |
      Removes duplicate copies of input rows.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory proportional to twice the output size.
    expansive: False
    example: "`Distinct`"

  - operator: TopK
    plan_types: "optimized,raw"
    description: |
      Groups the input rows by some scalar expressions, sorts each group using the group key, removes the top `offset` rows in each group, and returns the next `limit` rows.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Can use significant amount as the operator can significantly overestimate
      the group sizes. Consult
      [`mz_introspection.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_expected_group_size_advice).
    expansive: False
    example: "`TopK order_by=[#1 asc nulls_last, #0 desc nulls_first] limit=5`"

  - operator: TopK::~
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      The number after the operator is the input operator's `lir_id`.

      Groups the input rows, sorts them according to some ordering, and returns at most `K` rows at some offset from the top of the list, where `K` is some (possibly computed) limit.

      There are three types of `TopK`. Two are special cased for monotonic inputs (i.e., inputs which never retract data).

      1. `TopK::MonotonicTop1`.
      2. `TopK::MonotonicTopK`, which may give an expression indicating the limit.
      3. `TopK::Basic`, a generic `TopK` plan.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      `MonotonicTop1` or `MonotonicTopK` uses a moderate amount of memory. Other TopKs use significantly more memory as the operator can significantly overestimate
      the group sizes. Consult
      [`mz_introspection.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_expected_group_size_advice).
    expansive: False
    example: "`TopK::Basic 10`"


  - operator: Negate

    expansive: False
    example: "`Negate`"

  - operator: Negate

  - operator: Threshold
    plan_types: "optimized,raw"
    description: |

    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory proportional to the input and output size, twice.
    expansive: False
    example: "`Threshold`"

  - operator: Threshold
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      Removes any rows with negative counts.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory proportional to the input and output size, twice.
    expansive: False
    example: "`Threshold 47`"

  - operator: Union
    plan_types: "optimized,raw"
    description: |
      Sums the counts of each row of all inputs. (Corresponds to `UNION ALL` rather than `UNION`/`UNION DISTINCT`.)
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Moderate use of memory. Some union operators force consolidation, which results in a memory spike, largely at hydration time.
    expansive: False
    example: "`Union`"

  - operator: Union
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      Combines its inputs into a unified output, emitting one row for each row on any input. (Corresponds to `UNION ALL` rather than `UNION`/`UNION DISTINCT`.)
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      If the union "consolidates output", it will make moderate use of memory, particularly at hydration time. If the union is not marked with "consolidates output", it will not consume memory.
    expansive: False
    example: "`Union 7 10 11 14 (consolidates output)`"

  - operator: ArrangeBy
    plan_types: "optimized"
    description: |
      Indicates a point that will become an [arrangement](/get-started/arrangements/#arrangements) in the dataflow engine (each `keys` element will be a different arrangement). Note that if an appropriate index already exists on the input or the output of the previous operator is already arranged with a key that is also requested here, then this operator will just pass on that existing arrangement instead of creating a new one.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Depends. If arrangements need to be created, they use memory proportional to the input size.
    expansive: False
    example: "`ArrangeBy keys=[[#0]]`"

  - operator: Arrange
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      Indicates a point that will become an [arrangement](/get-started/arrangements/#arrangements) in the dataflow engine, i.e., it will consume memory to cache results.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory proportional to the input size. Note that in the LIR / physical plan, `Arrange`/`ArrangeBy` almost always means that an arrangement will actually be created. (This is in contrast to the "optimized" plan, where an `ArrangeBy` being present in the plan often does not mean that an arrangement will actually be created.)
    expansive: False
    example: "`Arrange 12`"

  - operator: With ... Return ...
    plan_types: "optimized,raw"
    description: |
      Introduces CTEs, i.e., makes it possible for sub-plans to be consumed multiple times by downstream operators.
    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: False
