  - operator: Get
    plan_types: "optimized,raw"
    description: |

  - operator: Stream, Arranged, Index Lookup, Read
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      Produces rows from either an existing relation (source/view/materialized view/table) or from a previous
      CTE in the same plan.
      A parent `Fused Map/Filter/Project` operator can combine with this operator.

      There are four types of `Get`.

      1. `Stream` indicates that the results are not [arranged](/get-started/arrangements/#arrangements) in memory
         and will be streamed directly.

      2. `Arranged` indicates that the results are [arranged](/get-started/arrangements/#arrangements) in memory.

      2. `Index Lookup` indicates the results will be
         _looked up_ in an existing [arrangement]((/get-started/arrangements/#arrangements).

      3. `Read` indicates that the results are unarranged,
          and will be processed as they arrive.

    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: False
    example: "`Arranged materialize.public.t`"

  - operator: Project
    plan_types: "optimized,raw"
    description: |
      Produces a subset of the [columns](#explain-plan-columns) in the input
      rows. See also [column numbering](#explain-plan-columns).
    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: False
    expansive_details: |
      Each row has _less_ data (i.e., shorter rows, but same number of rows).
    example: "`Project (#2, #3)`"

  - operator: Map
    plan_types: "optimized,raw"
    description: |
      Appends the results of some scalar expressions to each row in the input.
    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      Each row has more data (i.e., longer rows but same number of rows).
    example: "`Map (((#1 * 10000000dec) / #2) * 1000dec)`"

  - operator: Map/Filter/Project
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      Computes new columns (maps), filters columns, and projects away columns. Works row-by-row.
      Maps and filters will be printed, but projects will not.

      These may be marked as **`Fused`** `Map/Filter/Project`, which means they will combine with the operator beneath them to run more efficiently.
    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      Each row may have more data, from the `Map`.
      Each row may also have less data, from the `Project`.
      There may be fewer rows, from the `Filter`.

    example: |
      ```mzsql
      →Map/Filter/Project
        Filter: (#0{a} < 7)
        Map: (#0{a} + #1{b})
      ```

  - operator: FlatMap
    plan_types: "optimized"
    description: |
      Appends the result of some (one-to-many) [table function](/sql/functions/#table-functions) to each row in the input.
    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      Depends on the [table function](/sql/functions/#table-functions) used.
    example: "`FlatMap jsonb_foreach(#3)`"

  - operator: Table Function
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      Appends the result of some (one-to-many) [table function](/sql/functions/#table-functions) to each row in the input.

      A parent `Fused Table Function unnest_list` operator will fuse with its child `GroupAggregate` operator. Fusing these operator is part of how we efficiently compile window functions from SQL to dataflows.

      A parent `Fused Map/Filter/Project` can combine with this operator.

    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      Depends on the [table function](/sql/functions/#table-functions) used.
    example: |
      ```mzsql
      →Table Function generate_series(#0{a}, #1{b}, 1)
        Input key: (#0{a})
      ```

  - operator: CallTable
    plan_types: "raw"
    description: |
      Appends the result of some (one-to-many) [table function](/sql/functions/#table-functions) to each row in the input.
    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      Depends on the [table function](/sql/functions/#table-functions) used.
    example: "`CallTable generate_series(1, 7, 1)`"

  - operator: Filter
    plan_types: "optimized,raw"
    description: |
      Removes rows of the input for which some scalar predicates return `false`.
    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: False
    example: "`Filter (#20 < #21)`"
    expansive_details: |
      May reduce the number of rows.

  - operator: ~Join
    plan_types: "raw"
    description: |
      Performs one of `INNER` / `LEFT` / `RIGHT` / `FULL OUTER` / `CROSS` join on the two inputs, using the given predicate.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory proportional to the input sizes, unless [the inputs have appropriate indexes](/transform-data/optimization/#join). Certain joins with more than 2 inputs use additional memory, see details in the optimized plan.
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      For `CrossJoin`s, Cartesian product of the inputs (|N| x |M|). Note that, in many cases, a join that shows up as a cross join in the RAW PLAN will actually be turned into an inner join in the OPTIMIZED PLAN, by making use of an equality WHERE condition.
      For other join types, depends on the join order and facts about the joined collections.
    example: "`InnerJoin (#0 = #2)`"

  - operator: Join
    plan_types: "optimized"
    description: |
      Returns combinations of rows from each input whenever some equality predicates are `true`.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      The `Join` operator itself uses memory only for `type=differential` with more than 2 inputs.
      However, `Join` operators need [arrangements](/get-started/arrangements/#arrangements) on their inputs (shown by the `ArrangeBy` operator).
      These arrangements use memory proportional to the input sizes. If an input has an [appropriate index](/transform-data/optimization/#join), then the arrangement of the index will be reused.
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      Depends on the join order and facts about the joined collections.
    example: "`Join on=(#1 = #2) type=delta`"

  - operator: Differential Join, Delta Join
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      Both join operators indicate the join ordering selected.

      Returns combinations of rows from each input whenever some equality predicates are `true`.

      Joins will indicate the join order of their children, starting from 0.
      For example, `Differential Join %1 » %0` will join its second child into its first.

      The [two joins differ in performance characteristics](/transform-data/optimization/#join).
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory for 3-way or more differential joins.
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      Depends on the join order and facts about the joined collections.
    example: |
      ```mzsql
      →Differential Join %1 » %0
        Join stage %0: Lookup key #0{a} in %0
      ```

  - operator: CrossJoin
    plan_types: "optimized"
    description: |
      An alias for a `Join` with an empty predicate (emits all combinations). Note that not all cross joins are marked
      as `CrossJoin`: In a join with more than 2 inputs, it can happen that there is a cross join between some of the inputs.
      You can recognize this case by `ArrangeBy` operators having empty keys, i.e., `ArrangeBy keys=[[]]`.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory for 3-way or more differential joins.
    expansive: True
    expansive_details: |
      Cartesian product of the inputs (|N| x |M|).
    example: "`CrossJoin type=differential`"

  - operator: Reduce
    plan_types: "optimized"
    description: |
      Groups the input rows by some scalar expressions, reduces each group using some aggregate functions, and produces rows containing the group key and aggregate outputs.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      `SUM`, `COUNT`, and most other aggregations use a moderate amount of memory (proportional either to twice the output size or to input size + output size).
      `MIN` and `MAX` aggregates can use significantly more memory. This can be improved by including group size hints in the query, see
      [`mz_introspection.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_expected_group_size_advice).
    expansive: False
    example: "`Reduce group_by=[#0] aggregates=[max((#0 * #1))]`"

  - operator: GroupAggregate
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      Groups the input rows by some scalar expressions, reduces each group using some aggregate functions, and produces rows containing the group key and aggregate outputs.

      There are five types of `GroupAggregate`, ordered by increasing complexity:

      1. `Distinct GroupAggregate` corresponds to the SQL `DISTINCT` operator.

      2. `Accumulable GroupAggregate` (e.g., `SUM`, `COUNT`) corresponds to several easy to implement aggregations that can be executed simultaneously and efficiently.

      3. `Hierarchical GroupAggregate` (e.g., `MIN`, `MAX`) corresponds to an aggregation requiring a tower of arrangements. These can be either monotonic (more efficient) or bucketed. These may benefit from a hint; [see `mz_introspection.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_expected_group_size_advice).
         These may either be bucketed or monotonic (more efficient).
         These may consolidate their output, which will increase memory usage.

      4. `Collated Multi-GroupAggregate` corresponds to an arbitrary mix of reductions of different types, which will be performed separately and then joined together.

      5. `Non-incremental GroupAggregate` (e.g., window functions, `list_agg`) corresponds to a single non-incremental aggregation.
         These are the most computationally intensive reductions.

      A parent `Fused Map/Filter/Project` can combine with this operator.

    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      `Distinct` and `Accumulable` aggregates use a moderate amount of memory (proportional to twice the output size).
      `MIN` and `MAX` aggregates can use significantly more memory. This can be improved by including group size hints in the query, see
      [`mz_introspection.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_expected_group_size_advice).
      `Non-incremental` aggregates use memory proportional to the input + output size.
      `Collated` aggregates use memory that is the sum of their constituents, plus some memory for the join at the end.
    expansive: False
    example: |
      ```mzsql
      →Accumulable GroupAggregate
        Simple aggregates: count(*)
        Post-process Map/Filter/Project
          Filter: (#0 > 1)
      ```

  - operator: Reduce
    plan_types: "raw"
    description: |
      Groups the input rows by some scalar expressions, reduces each group using
      some aggregate functions, and produces rows containing the group key and
      aggregate outputs.  In the case where the group key is empty and the input
      is empty, returns a single row with the aggregate functions applied to the
      empty input collection.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      `SUM`, `COUNT`, and most other aggregations use a moderate amount of memory (proportional either to twice the output size or to input size + output size).
      `MIN` and `MAX` aggregates can use significantly more memory. This can be improved by including group size hints in the query, see
      [`mz_introspection.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_expected_group_size_advice).
    expansive: False
    example: "`Reduce group_by=[#0] aggregates=[max((#0 * #1))]`"

  - operator: Distinct
    plan_types: "optimized"
    description: |
      Alias for a `Reduce` with an empty aggregate list.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory proportional to twice the output size.
    expansive: False
    example: "`Distinct`"

  - operator: Distinct
    plan_types: "raw"
    description: |
      Removes duplicate copies of input rows.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory proportional to twice the output size.
    expansive: False
    example: "`Distinct`"

  - operator: TopK
    plan_types: "optimized,raw"
    description: |
      Groups the input rows by some scalar expressions, sorts each group using the group key, removes the top `offset` rows in each group, and returns the next `limit` rows.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Can use significant amount as the operator can significantly overestimate
      the group sizes. Consult
      [`mz_introspection.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_expected_group_size_advice).
    expansive: False
    example: "`TopK order_by=[#1 asc nulls_last, #0 desc nulls_first] limit=5`"

  - operator: TopK
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      Groups the input rows, sorts them according to some ordering, and returns at most `K` rows at some offset from the top of the list, where `K` is some (possibly computed) limit.

      There are three types of `TopK`. Two are special cased for monotonic inputs (i.e., inputs which never retract data).

      1. `Monotonic Top1`.
      2. `Monotonic TopK`, which may give an expression indicating the limit.
      3. `Non-monotonic TopK`, a generic `TopK` plan.

      Each version of the `TopK` operator may include grouping, ordering, and limit directives.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      `Monotonic Top1` and `Monotonic TopK` use a moderate amount of memory. `Non-monotonic TopK` uses significantly more memory as the operator can significantly overestimate
      the group sizes. Consult
      [`mz_introspection.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_expected_group_size_advice).
    expansive: False
    example: |
      ```mzsql
      →Consolidating Monotonic TopK
        Order By #1 asc nulls_last, #0 desc nulls_first
        Limit 5
      ```

  - operator: Negate
    plan_types: "optimized,raw"
    description: |
      Negates the row counts of the input. This is usually used in combination with union to remove rows from the other union input.
    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: False
    example: "`Negate`"

  - operator: Negate Diffs
    plan_types: "LIR"

      Negates the row counts of the input. This is usually used in combination with union to remove rows from the other union input.
    uses_memory: False
    memory_details: ""
    expansive: False
    example: "`→Negate Diffs`"

  - operator: Threshold
    plan_types: "optimized,raw"
    description: |
      Removes any rows with negative counts.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory proportional to the input and output size, twice.
    expansive: False
    example: "`Threshold`"

  - operator: Threshold Diffs
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      Removes any rows with negative counts.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory proportional to the input and output size, twice.
    expansive: False
    example: "`→Threshold Diffs`"

  - operator: Union
    plan_types: "optimized,raw"
    description: |
      Sums the counts of each row of all inputs. (Corresponds to `UNION ALL` rather than `UNION`/`UNION DISTINCT`.)
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Moderate use of memory. Some union operators force consolidation, which results in a memory spike, largely at hydration time.
    expansive: False
    example: "`Union`"

  - operator: Union
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      Combines its inputs into a unified output, emitting one row for each row on any input. (Corresponds to `UNION ALL` rather than `UNION`/`UNION DISTINCT`.)
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      A `Consolidating Union` will make moderate use of memory, particularly at hydration time. A `Union` that is not `Consolidating` will not consume memory.
    expansive: False
    example: "`→Consolidating Union`"

  - operator: ArrangeBy
    plan_types: "optimized"
    description: |
      Indicates a point that will become an [arrangement](/get-started/arrangements/#arrangements) in the dataflow engine (each `keys` element will be a different arrangement). Note that if an appropriate index already exists on the input or the output of the previous operator is already arranged with a key that is also requested here, then this operator will just pass on that existing arrangement instead of creating a new one.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Depends. If arrangements need to be created, they use memory proportional to the input size.
    expansive: False
    example: "`ArrangeBy keys=[[#0]]`"

  - operator: Arrange
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      Indicates a point that will become an [arrangement](/get-started/arrangements/#arrangements) in the dataflow engine, i.e., it will consume memory to cache results.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |
      Uses memory proportional to the input size. Note that in the LIR / physical plan, `Arrange`/`ArrangeBy` almost always means that an arrangement will actually be created. (This is in contrast to the "optimized" plan, where an `ArrangeBy` being present in the plan often does not mean that an arrangement will actually be created.)
    expansive: False
    example: |
      ```mzsql
      →Arrange
          Keys: 1 arrangement available, plus raw stream
            Arrangement 0: #0
      ```
  - operator: Unarranged Raw Stream
    plan_types: "LIR"
    description: |
      Indicates a point where data will be streamed (even if it is somehow already arranged).
    uses_memory: False
    expansive: False
    example: "`→Unarranged Raw Stream`"


  - operator: With ... Return ...
    plan_types: "optimized,raw,LIR"
