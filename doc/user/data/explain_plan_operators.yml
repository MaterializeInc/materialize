      1. `Get::PassArrangements`, which means the plan will use an
         existing arrangement.

      2. `Get::Arrangement`, which means that the results will be
         _looked up_ in an existing arrangement.

      3. `Get::Collection`, which means that the results are
         unarranged, and will be processed as they arrive.

      Groups the input rows by some scalar expressions, reduces each group using some aggregate functions, and produces rows containing the group key and aggregate outputs.

      There are five types of `Reduce`, ordered by increasing complexity:

      1. `Reduce::Distinct` corresponds to the SQL `DISTINCT` operator.

      2. `Reduce::Accumulable` corresponds to several easy to implement aggregations that can be done simultaneously.

      3. `Reduce::Hierarchical` corresponds to an aggregation requiring a tower of arrangements. These can be either monotonic (more efficient) or bucketed. These may benefit from a hint; [see `mz_introspection.mz_expected_group_size_advice`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_introspection/#mz_expected_group_size_advice).

      4. `Reduce::Collation` corresponds to an arbitrary mix of reductions, which will be performed separately and then joined together.

      5. `Reduce::Basic` corresponds to a single hard-to-incrementalize aggregation.

      Groups the input rows, sorts them according to some ordering, and returns at most `K` rows at some offset from the top of the list, where `K` is some (possibly computed) limit.

      There are three types of `TopK`. Two are special cased for monotonic inputs (i.e., inputs which never retract data).

      1. `TopK::MonotonicTop1`.
      2. `TopK::MonotonicTopK`, which may give an expression indicating the limit.
