    memory_details: |
      Can use significant amount as the operator can significantly overestimate
      the size. For `MIN` and `MAX` aggregates, consult

  - operator: Reduce
    plan_types: "raw"
    description: |
      Groups the input rows by some scalar expressions, reduces each group using
      some aggregate functions, and produces rows containing the group key and

      is empty, returns a single row with the aggregate functions applied to the
      empty input collection.
    uses_memory: True
    memory_details: |

  - operator: TopK
    plan_types: "optimized,raw"

      the size. Consult

    description: |
      Sums the counts of each row of all inputs.

      Moderate use of memory. Union stages force consolidation, which results in a memory spike, largely at hydration time.

    example: "`Union`"

  - operator: ArrangeBy
    plan_types: "optimized"
    description: |
      Indicates a point that will become an arrangement in the dataflow engine (each `keys` element will be a different arrangement).

    memory_details: |
      Depends. When it does, uses memory proportional to the number of input updates.
