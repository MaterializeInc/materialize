  - query: |
      ```mzsql
      SELECT * FROM orders_view WHERE quantity = 10 OR quantity = 20;
      ```

  - query: |
      ```mzsql

      ```
    index_usage: |
      Point lookup on `quantity`, then filter on `price`.

  - query: |
      ```mzsql
      SELECT * FROM orders_view WHERE quantity = 10 OR price = 5.00;
      ```
    index_usage: |
      Index scan. Query uses `OR` to combine conditions on **different** fields.

  - query: |
      ```mzsql
      SELECT * FROM orders_view WHERE quantity <= 10;
      ```
    index_usage: Index scan.

  - query: |
      ```mzsql
      SELECT * FROM orders_view WHERE round(quantity) = 20;
      ```
    index_usage: Index scan.


  - query: |
      ```mzsql
      -- Assume quantity is an integer
      SELECT * FROM orders_view WHERE quantity = 'hello';
      SELECT * FROM orders_view WHERE quantity::TEXT = 'hello';
      ```
    index_usage: |
      Index scan, assuming `quantity` field in `orders_view` is an integer.
      In the first query, the quantity is implicitly cast to text.
