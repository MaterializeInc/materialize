      [`TYPE`](/sql/types/)

      `PUBLIC`
    "Granted to": |
      `PUBLIC`
    Description: |
      When a [data type](/sql/types/) is created (regardless of the owner), all
      roles are granted the `USAGE` privilege. However, to use a data type, the
      role must also have `USAGE` privilege on the schema containing the type.

  - "Default Privilege": "`CREATEDATAFLOW`"
    "Object(s)": |
      [`CLUSTER`](/concepts/clusters/)
    "Object owner": |
      `PUBLIC`
    "Granted to": |
      `PUBLIC`
    Description: |
      When a [cluster](/concepts/clusters/) is created (regardless of the owner),
      all roles are granted the `CREATEDATAFLOW` privilege by default. This ensures
      backwards compatibility and allows all users to execute queries that require
      dataflow rendering. Administrators can revoke this privilege to restrict
      users to only fast-path queries.
