  - Privilege: "**CREATEDATAFLOW**"
    Description: |

      Permission to execute queries that require dataflow rendering on a cluster.

      When a query cannot be satisfied by an existing index using a [fast path](/sql/explain-plan/#fast-path-queries),
      Materialize must render a temporary dataflow on the cluster. This privilege controls
      whether a role is allowed to trigger such dataflow rendering.

      Queries that can be answered using existing indexes (with optional map-filter-project
      operations) or constant queries (e.g., `SELECT 1 + 1`) do not require this privilege.

      This privilege is useful in production environments to prevent users from accidentally
      executing high-latency queries that require dataflow rendering, ensuring they only
      run queries that can be satisfied by existing indexes.

      {{< note >}}
      The [persist fast-path optimization](/sql/explain-plan/#fast-path-queries) is still
      available even without this privilege, as it does not render a dataflow.
