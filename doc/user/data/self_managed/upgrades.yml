    When upgrading:

    - **Always** check the [version specific upgrade
      notes](/self-managed-deployments/upgrading/#version-specific-upgrade-notes).

    - **Always** upgrade the operator **first** and ensure version compatibility
      between the operator and the Materialize instance you are upgrading to.

    - **Always** upgrade your Materialize instances **after** upgrading the operator
      to ensure compatibility.
