      configured size and replication factor.

      Specify `FALSE` to create an **unmanaged** cluster. With unmanaged
      clusters, you need to manually manage the cluster's replicas using the
      the [`CREATE CLUSTER REPLICA`](/sql/create-cluster-replica) and [`DROP
      CLUSTER REPLICA`](/sql/drop-cluster-replica) commands. When creating an
      unmanaged cluster, you must specify the `REPLICAS` option as well.

      When getting started with Materialize, we recommend starting with managed
      clusters.
