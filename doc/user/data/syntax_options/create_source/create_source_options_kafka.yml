columns:
  - column: "Parameter"
  - column: "Description"
rows:
  - "Parameter": "**IF NOT EXISTS**"
    "Description": |
      *Optional.* If specified, do not throw an error if a source with the same
      name already exists. Instead, issue a notice and skip the source creation.
  - "Parameter": "`<source_name>`"
    "Description": |

      The name of the source to create. Names for sources must follow the
      [naming guidelines](/sql/identifiers/#naming-restrictions).

  - "Parameter": "**IN CLUSTER** `<cluster_name>`"
    "Description": |
      *Optional.* The [cluster](/sql/create-cluster) to maintain this source. Otherwise, the source will be created in the active cluster.

      {{< tip >}}
      If possible, use a cluster dedicated just for sources. See also
      [Operational guidelines](/manage/operational-guidelines/#sources).
      {{< /tip >}}

  - "Parameter": "`<connection_name>`"
    "Description": |
      The name of the Kafka connection to use for the source. For details
      on creating connections, check the [`CREATE
      CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/#kafka) documentation page.

      A connection is **reusable** across multiple `CREATE SOURCE` statements.

  - "Parameter": "`<topic_name>`"
    "Description": |
      The name of the Kafka topic to subscribe to.

  - "Parameter": "`<group_id_prefix>`"
    "Description": |
      *Optional.* The prefix of the consumer group ID to use. See [Monitoring consumer
      lag](#monitoring-consumer-lag) for details.

      Default: materialize-{REGION-ID}-{CONNECTION-ID}-{SOURCE-ID}

  - "Parameter": "`START OFFSET (<partition1_offset>, ...)`"
    "Description": |
      *Optional.* Read partition(s) from the specified offset. You cannot update the offsets once a source has been created; you will need to recreate the source. Offset values must be zero or positive integers.

      - If fewer offsets than partitions are provided, the remaining partitions
      will start at offset 0. This is true if you provide START OFFSET (1) or
      START OFFSET (1, ...).
      - Providing more offsets than partitions is not supported.

  - "Parameter": "`START TIMESTAMP <timestamp>`"
    "Description": |
      *Optional.* Use the specified value to set the start offset based on the
      Kafka timestamp:

      - For positive values, the timestamp is expressed in milliseconds since
      epoch (e.g. `1759784465032` for `2025-10-06T21:01:05.032Z`).

      - For negative values, the timestamp is interpreted as relative to the
      current system time in milliseconds (e.g. `-1000` means 1000 ms ago).

      The offset for each partition will be the earliest offset whose timestamp
      is greater than or equal to the given timestamp in the corresponding
      partition. If no such offset exists for a partition, the partition's end
      offset will be used.

      - The `START TIMESTAMP` is a property of the source; it is calculated
        _once_ at the time of the `CREATE SOURCE` statement. This means that the computed start offsets will be the **same** for all views
        depending on the source and **stable** across restarts.

      - If you need to limit the amount of data maintained as state after source
        creation, consider using [temporal
        filters](/sql/patterns/temporal-filters/) instead.
