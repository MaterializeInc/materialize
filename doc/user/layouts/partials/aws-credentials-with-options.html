`access_key_id` | `text` | A valid [access key ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/controlling-access.html) for the AWS resource.
`secret_access_key` | `text` | A valid [secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/controlling-access.html) for the AWS resource.
`token` | `text` | The session token associated with the credentials, if the credentials are temporary
`timestamp_frequency_ms`| `int` | Default: `1000`. Sets the timestamping frequency in `ms`. Reflects how frequently the source advances its timestamp. This measure reflects how stale data in views will be. Lower values result in more-up-to-date views but may reduce throughput.

If you do not provide credentials via with options then `materialized` will examine the standard
AWS authorization chain:

1. Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
2. `credential_process` command in the AWS config file, usually located at `~/.aws/config`.
3. AWS credentials file. Usually located at `~/.aws/credentials`.
4. IAM instance profile. Will only work if running on an EC2 instance with an instance
   profile/role.

Credentials fetched from a container or instance profile expire on a fixed
schedule. Materialize will attempt to refresh the credentials automatically
before they expire, but the source will become inoperable if the refresh
operation fails.
