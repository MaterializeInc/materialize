### File source details

`path` values must be the file's absolute path, e.g.

```sql
CREATE SOURCE server_source FROM FILE '/Users/sean/server.log'...
```

#### Compression

- Omitting `COMPRESSION` is equivalent to `COMPRESSION NONE`.
- Using `GZIP` compression requires the file to be a normal `.gz` file (e.g.
  one produced by `gzip`) or a concatenation of multiple `gzip` member streams.
