### File source details

`path` values must be the file's absolute path, e.g.

```sql
CREATE SOURCE server_source FROM FILE '/Users/sean/server.log'...
```

#### Compression

When `COMPRESSION` is omitted no decompression attempt is made and the behavior
is identical to `COMPRESSION NONE`.

When using the `GZIP` compression option the file is expected to be a normal
gzipped file (e.g as one produced by gzip) or a concatenation of multiple gzip
member streams.
