### Kafka source details

- Materialize expects each source to use one Kafka topic, which is&mdash;in
  turn&mdash;generated by a single table in an upstream database.
- {{ if in $.envelopes "upsert" }}By default, Materialize only ingests message
  payloads, not their keys. Avro-formatted sources, though, can work with message
  keys using the [Upsert envelope](#upsert-envelope-details).
- {{ end }}Materialize supports connecting to
  [SSL-encrypted](#ssl-encrypted-kafka-details) or
  [Kerberized Kafka clusters](#kerberized-kafka-details).

#### Cached Kafka sources

To avoid re-reading data from Kafka on restart, Materialize lets you create
cached sources, which cache input messages from Kafka topics to files on
the Materialize instance's local hard drive. For more details on source caching,
see [Deployment: Source Caching][caching].

[Example][example]

[caching]: /ops/deployment/#source-caching
[example]: #caching-records-to-local-disk

#### SSL-encrypted Kafka details

Enable connections to SSL-encrypted Kafka clusters using the appropriate
[`WITH` options](#ssl-with-options).

- To encrypt data coming from the Kafka broker, authenticate its identity by
  providing a copy of the CA certificate that signed the broker's certificate
  (`ssl_ca_location`).
- To connect Materialize to a Kafka cluster that requires SSL authentication,
  create a client key pair for Materialize, and then provide the certificate,
  key, and optional key password (`ssl_certificate_location`, `ssl_key_location`,
  `ssl_key_password`, respectively). Note that this also requires authenticating
  the server.
- Materialize can also connect to a Confluent Schema Registry if it uses the same
  CA as the Kafka broker.

#### Kerberized Kafka details

Enable connections to Kerberized Kafka clusters using the appropriate [`WITH`
options](#kerberos-with-options).

- Materialize currently only supports:
  - `GSSAPI` as the `sasl_mechanisms`
  - `sasl_plaintext`, `scram-sha-256`, or `scram-sha-512`  as the `security_protocol`
- Materialize does _not_ support Kerberos authentication for Confluent Schema
  Registries.
