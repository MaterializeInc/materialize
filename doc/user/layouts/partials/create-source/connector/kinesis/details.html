### Kinesis source details

- Materialize expects each source to use to one Kinesis stream, which
  is&mdash;in turn&mdash;generated by a single table in an upstream database.
- **Permissions**:
  - By default, Materialize will try to read credentials automatically
    via [Rusoto's ChainProvider](https://docs.rs/rusoto_credential/0.44.0/rusoto_credential/struct.ChainProvider.html).
    If credentials are explicitly provided, those will be used instead.
  - The IAM account whose credentials you provide requires
    `kinesis-read` permissions and access to `ListStreams` and `Read`.
- Kinesis sources will only have one column, which will be named `data`.
