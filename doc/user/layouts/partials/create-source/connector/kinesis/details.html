### Kinesis source details

- Materialize expects each source to use to one Kinesis stream, which
  is&mdash;in turn&mdash;generated by a single table in an upstream database.
- **Permissions**: The IAM account whose credentials you provide requires
  `kinesis-read` permissions and access to `ListStreams` and `Read`.
- Kinesis sources will only have one column, which will be named `data`.
