### Kinesis source details

- A Kinesis source represents a single Kinesis stream.
- **Permissions**:
  - By default, Materialize will try to read credentials automatically
    via [Rusoto's ChainProvider](https://docs.rs/rusoto_credential/0.44.0/rusoto_credential/struct.ChainProvider.html).
    If credentials are explicitly provided, those will be used instead.
  - The IAM account whose credentials you provide requires
    `kinesis-read` permissions and access to `ListStreams` and `Read`.
- Kinesis sources will only have one column, which will be named `data`.
- The following Kinesis features are not yet supported:
  - Kinesis resharding
  - Consistent Kinesis sources
  - Enhanced fan-out Kinesis consumers
  - Reading from a Kinesis stream as of a sequence number or timestamp
