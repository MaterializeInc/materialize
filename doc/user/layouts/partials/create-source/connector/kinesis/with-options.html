details](#kinesis-source-details).

If AWS credentials are not explicitly provided, Materialize wlil attempt to
fetch credentials by reading standard environment variables, filesystem paths,
and, if running on AWS ECS or EC2, the container or instance profile. Consult
the [Rusoto credentials
documentation](https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto/blob/master/AWS-CREDENTIALS.md#usage)
for details.

Credentials fetched from a container or instance profile expire on a fixed
schedule. Materialize will attempt to refresh the credentials automatically
before they expire, but the source will become inoperable if the refresh
operation fails.
