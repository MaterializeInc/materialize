### S3 source details

The S3 source is designed to ingest a large volume of static data from S3.

#### S3 Limitations

* Currently S3 sources do not support Avro-encoded objects.
* **All S3 sources are append-only** -- deleted and updated [S3 Objects][] are silently ignored.

#### Scanning S3 Buckets

The **OBJECTS FROM SCAN BUCKET** syntax causes S3 sources to issue [ListBucket][] requests to collect the
names of objects to collect. After collecting the list of keys, their names are checked against
the **MATCHING** clause, if present, before downloading and extracting objects line by line.

#### Patterns

It is possible to filter the list of object keys to download using unix-style glob syntax as an
argument to the `MATCHING` clause:

* `?` matches any single character except `/`.
* `*` matches zero or more characters except `/`.
* `**` recursively matches directories, but some other pattern must be specified. For example
  `a/**` matches anything inside of the `a/` prefix (but not `a/` itself), and `**/a` matches `a`
  in any prefix, but not `a` with no prefix.
* `{a,b}` matches `a` or `b` where `a` and `b` are arbitrary glob patterns.
* `[ab]` matches `a` or `b` where `a` and `b` are characters. Prepending `!` to the matched
  characters inverts the match, e.g. `[!ab]` matches any character besides `a` or `b`.
* Metacharacters such as `*` and `?` can be escaped with character class notation. e.g., `[*]`
  matches `*`.

##### Pattern Examples

| Pattern            | Example Matches     | Example Excludes                           |
|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `**`               | `a` , `a/b/c.json`  | none                                       |
| `2020/**/*.json`   | `2020/11/uuid.json` | `data/2020/uuid.json` , `2020/11/uuid.csv` |
| `*`                | `a`                 | `a/b`                                      |
| `202{0,1}/*/*.csv` | `2020/11/data.csv`  | `2022/11/data.csv` , `2020/11/01/data.csv` |
