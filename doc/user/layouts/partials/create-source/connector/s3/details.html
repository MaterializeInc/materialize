### S3 source details

The S3 source is designed to ingest a large volume of static data from [AWS's Simple Storage
Service][aws-s3]. S3 is Amazon Web Services' cloud object store. It is important to note that an
object store behaves differently than a file system does, and that those differences affect how
Materialize interacts with objects in it.

Some key differences from file systems include:

* Latency on individual S3 operations is much higher than even cloud-network filesystems.
* It is not possible to seek to a point in an object, the entire object must be downloaded from
  the beginning in order to read to a point.
* All object operations are atomic, and it is not possible to modify just part of an S3 object,
  you can only entirely replace or delete objects.

The primary effect of this is that we do not handle *updates* to S3 objects, and we may interleave
multiple object ingestion to speed it up.

#### S3 Limitations

* Currently S3 sources do not support Avro- or Protobuf- encoded objects. Implementation issues:
  [Avro](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/5596),
  [Protobuf](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/5597)
* Object ingest order is not guaranteed.
* **All S3 sources are append-only** -- deleted and updated [S3 Objects][] are silently ignored.

#### Object discovery strategies

Materialize has several techniques to discover the objects to download, with [more
planned][object-specifiers] for the future. Strategies may be specified multiple times within one
**CREATE SOURCE** statement, so for example this is a legal invocation: `OBJECTS FROM SCAN BUCKET
'example', SCAN BUCKET 'other', SQS NOTIFICATIONS 'example-notifications'`.

All strategies follow the same basic pattern, `materialized` will:

* Interact with a collection of AWS APIs.
* Deduplicate objects such that the same object is never downloaded twice.
* Filter the list of objects discovered via those APIs against the [**MATCHING** clause
  patterns](#patterns).
* Treat each object downloaded as a newline-delimited file for the purposes of record
  delimitation.

No guarantees are made about the relative order of records sent from the object discovery process
and the Materialize SQL engine, as usual with SQL you must impose your own order.

##### Scanning S3 Buckets

The **OBJECTS FROM SCAN BUCKET** syntax causes S3 sources to issue [ListBucket][] requests to
collect the names of objects to collect. After collecting the list of keys, their names are
checked against the **MATCHING** clause, if present, before downloading and extracting objects
line by line.

##### Listening to SQS Notifications

AWS S3 has a built-in method for notifying downstream applications of bucket modification, the
[Event Notification API][notification-aws]. For the purpose of `materialized` the only interesting
modifications are object creation, aka the `s3:ObjectCreated:*` event namespace. Following [the
AWS Tutorial][notification-tutorial] will configure a bucket for exactly this namespace.

Once you have configured S3 notifications to go to an SQS queue you can point materialized at that
queue via **OBJECTS FROM SQS NOTIFICATIONS `'queue-name'`**.

#### Patterns

It is possible to filter the list of object keys to download using unix-style glob syntax as an
argument to the `MATCHING` clause:

* `?` matches any single character except `/`.
* `*` matches zero or more characters except `/`.
* `**` recursively matches directories, but some other pattern must be specified. For example
  `a/**` matches anything inside of the `a/` prefix (but not `a/` itself), and `**/a` matches `a`
  in any prefix, but not `a` with no prefix.
* `{a,b}` matches `a` or `b` where `a` and `b` are arbitrary glob patterns.
* `[ab]` matches `a` or `b` where `a` and `b` are characters. Prepending `!` to the matched
  characters inverts the match, e.g. `[!ab]` matches any character besides `a` or `b`.
* Metacharacters such as `*` and `?` can be escaped with character class notation. e.g., `[*]`
  matches `*`.

| Pattern            | Example Matches     | Example Excludes                           |
|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `**`               | `a` , `a/b/c.json`  | none                                       |
| `2020/**/*.json`   | `2020/11/uuid.json` | `data/2020/uuid.json` , `2020/11/uuid.csv` |
| `*`                | `a`                 | `a/b`                                      |
| `202{0,1}/*/*.csv` | `2020/11/data.csv`  | `2022/11/data.csv` , `2020/11/01/data.csv` |
