##### Permissions Required

The IAM User or Role that `materialized` is operating as requires permission to perform different
AWS actions depending on what what actions are required in order for `materialized` to discover
the list of objects to download.

The **OBJECTS FROM** clause describes how `materialized` will load objects, and so its parameters
will determine what permissions `materialized` requires.. For example, since the **SCAN** key name
source (as in **OBJECTS FORM SCAN**) must perform repeated `ListObjects` actions to create a list
of key names to download, specifying **OBJECTS FROM SCAN BUCKET** means that **MATERIALIZED** requires
the `ListObjects` permission.

| Key Name Source       | Permissions Required                                                                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All                   | [`GetObject` permission][getobject] for the objects that they will download              |
| **SCAN BUCKET**       | [`ListObject` permission][listobject] for the buckets it will scan                       |
| **SQS NOTIFICATIONS** | `GetMessage`, `GetQueueUrl` [SQS Permissions][sqs-perms] for the queue it will listen to |
