`timestamp_frequency_ms`| `int` | Default: `1000`. Sets the timestamping frequency in `ms`. Reflects how frequently the source advances its timestamp. This measure reflects how stale data in views will be. Lower values result in more-up-to-date views but may reduce throughput.

##### Permissions Required

The IAM User or Role used by `materialized` requires permission to perform different
AWS actions depending on which actions are required to discover
the list of objects to download.

The `DISCOVER OBJECTS USING` clause describes how Materialize will load objects, and so its parameters
 determine which permissions `materialized` requires. For example, since the `SCAN` key name
source (as in `DISCOVER OBJECTS USING BUCKET SCAN`) must perform repeated `ListObjects` actions to create a list
of key names to download, you must grant the Materialize IAM User or Role the `ListObjects` permission before you specify `DISCOVER OBJECTS USING BUCKET SCAN`.

| Key name source       | Permissions required                                                                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All                   | [`GetObject` permission][getobject] for the objects to be downloaded              |
| **BUCKET SCAN**       | [`ListObject` permission][listobject] for the buckets to be scanned, **unless** the `MATCHING` pattern can only match a single object. In such cases, Materialize will perform only the necessary `GetObject` API call. |
| **SQS NOTIFICATIONS** | `ChangeMessageVisibility`, `DeleteMessage`, `GetQueueUrl`, `ReceiveMessage` [SQS Permissions][sqs-perms] for the queue Materialize will listen to |
