### Debezium envelope details

The Debezium envelope describes the decoded records' old and new values; this is roughly equivalent
to the notion of Change Data Capture (CDC).

To use the Debezium envelope with Materialize, you must configure Debezium with your database.

- [MySQL](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.10/connectors/mysql.html)
- [PostgreSQL](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.10/connectors/postgresql.html)

<div class="warning"> <strong>WARNING!</strong> Debezium can produce duplicate records if the
    connector is interrupted. Materialize makes a best-effort attempt to detect and filter out
    duplicates generated by the MySQL and PostgreSQL connectors. It does not yet attempt to detect
    duplicates generated by other Debezium connectors. </div>

The Debezium envelope is most easily supported by sources published to Kafka by Debezium.

#### Format implications

Using the Debezium envelopes changes the schema of your Avro-encoded Kafka topics to include
something akin to the following field:

```json
{
    "type": "record",
    "name": "envelope",
    "fields": [
        {
        "name": "before",
        "type": [
            {
            "name": "row",
            "type": "record",
            "fields": [
                {"name": "a", "type": "long"},
                {"name": "b", "type": "long"}
            ]
            },
            "null"
        ]
        },
        { "name": "after", "type": ["row", "null"] }
    ]
}
```

Note that:

- If you use the Confluent Schema Registry to receive your schemas, you don't
  need to manually create this field; Debezium will have taken care of it for
  you.
- The following section depends on the column's names and types, and is unlikely
  to match our example:
    ```json
    ...
    "fields": [
            {"name": "a", "type": "long"},
            {"name": "b", "type": "long"}
        ]
    ...
    ```

#### Kafka topic requirements

`ENVELOPE DEBEZIUM` by itself is incompatible with Kafka's [log compaction][].
You must specify `ENVELOPE DEBEZIUM UPSERT` if you enable compaction of a topic
carrying Debezium data. The `DEBEZIUM UPSERT` envelope uses memory proportional
to the size of the upstream database table.
