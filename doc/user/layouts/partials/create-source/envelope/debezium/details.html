### Debezium envelope details

The Debezium envelope provides a "diff envelope", which describes the decoded
records' old and new values; this is roughly equivalent to the notion of Change
Data Capture, or CDC. Materialize can use the data in this diff envelope to
process data as representing inserts, updates, or deletes.

This envelope is called the Debezium envelope because it's been developed to
explicitly work with [Debezium].

To use the Debezium envelope with Materialize, you must configure Debezium with
your database.

- [MySQL](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.10/connectors/mysql.html)
- [PostgreSQL](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/0.10/connectors/postgresql.html)

The Debezium envelope is most easily supported by sources published to Kafka by
Debezium.

#### Format implications

Using the Debezium envelopes changes the schema of your Avro-encoded Kafka
topics to include something akin to the following field:

```json
{
    "type": "record",
    "name": "envelope",
    "fields": [
        {
        "name": "before",
        "type": [
            {
            "name": "row",
            "type": "record",
            "fields": [
                {"name": "a", "type": "long"},
                {"name": "b", "type": "long"}
            ]
            },
            "null"
        ]
        },
        { "name": "after", "type": ["row", "null"] }
    ]
}
```

Note that:

- If you use the Confluent Schema Registry to receive your schemas, you don't
  need to manually create this field; Debezium will have taken care of it for
  you.
- The following section depends on the column's names and types, and is unlikely
  to match our example:
    ```json
    ...
    "fields": [
            {"name": "a", "type": "long"},
            {"name": "b", "type": "long"}
        ]
    ...
    ```
