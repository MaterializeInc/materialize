**ENVELOPE DEBEZIUM** | Use the Debezium envelope, which uses a diff envelope to handle CRUD operations. This option requires payloads have the [appropriate fields](#format-implications), is generally only supported by sources published to Kafka by [Debezium], and is incompatible with [Kafka compaction](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#compaction). For more information, see [Debezium envelope details](#debezium-envelope-details).
**ENVELOPE DEBEZIUM UPSERT** | Use the Debezium envelope with `UPSERT` enabled. This is required for Kafka sources with log compaction, but increases memory consumption.
