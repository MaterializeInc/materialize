**ENVELOPE DEBEZIUM** | Use the Debezium envelope, which uses a diff envelope to handle CRUD operations. For more information, see [Using Debezium](/sql/create-source/kafka#using-debezium).
**ENVELOPE DEBEZIUM UPSERT** | Use the Debezium envelope with `UPSERT` enabled. This is required for Kafka sources with log compaction, but increases memory consumption.
