### CSV format details

Materialize uses the format method you specify to determine the number of
columns to create in the source, as well as the columns' names.

Method | Outcome
-------|--------
**HEADER** (name_list) | All of the same behaviors as bare **HEADER** with the additional features that:<br/><br/>&bull; Header names from source objects will be validated to exactly match those specified in the name list.<br/><br/>&bull; Specifying a column list allows using CSV format with sources that have headers but individual objects may not yet exist. Primarily this is intended for S3 sources.
_n_ **COLUMNS** | &bull; Materialize treats the file as if it has _n_ columns.<br/><br/>&bull; Columns are named `column1`, `column2`...`columnN`.

Note that:

- You can override these naming conventions by explicitly naming columns using
  the _col&lowbar;name_ option in `CREATE SOURCE`.
- All rows without the number of columns determined by the format are dropped,
  and Materialize logs an error.
- To avoid case-sensitivity conflicts with Materialize identifiers, we recommend you double-quote all field names when working with Avro-formatted sources. For more information, see [Identifiers: Case sensitivity](/sql/identifiers/#case-sensitivity).

#### Types

Materialize treats all columns in CSV sources as [`text`](/sql/types/text).
You can "type" this data using [casts](/sql/functions/cast/) when creating views
using this source, e.g.:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW salaries AS
  SELECT (employee_id::int, salary::numeric(38, 2))
  FROM csv_employee_data;
```
