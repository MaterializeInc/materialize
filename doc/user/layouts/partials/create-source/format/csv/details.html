### CSV format details

Materialize uses the format method you specify to determine the number of
columns to create in the source, as well as the columns' names.

Method | Outcome
-------|--------
**HEADER** | Materialize reads the first line of the file to determine:<br/><br/>&bull; The number of columns in the file<br/><br/>&bull; The name of each column<br/><br/>The first line of the file is not ingested as data.
_n_ **COLUMNS** | &bull; Materialize treats the file as if it has _n_ columns.<br/><br/>&bull; Columns are named `column1`, `column2`...`columnN`.

- You can override these naming conventions by explicitly naming columns using
  the _col&lowbar;name_ option in `CREATE SOURCE`.
- All rows without the number of columns determined by the format are dropped,
  and Materialize logs an error.
