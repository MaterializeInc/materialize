### Raw byte format details

Raw byte-formatted sources provide Materialize the raw bytes received from the
source without applying any formatting or decoding.

Raw byte-formatted sources have one column, which, by default, is named `data`.

### Extracting JSON data from bytes

Materialize cannot receive JSON data directly from a source. Instead, you must
create a source that stores the data it receives as raw bytes (**FORMAT
BYTES**), and then construct views that provides access to your JSON data by
casting the source's [`bytea`](/sql/types/bytea) column (named `data`) to
[`text`](/sql/types/text), and then to [`jsonb`](/sql/types/jsonb).

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW jsonified_bytes AS
SELECT CAST(data AS JSONB) AS data
FROM (
    SELECT CONVERT_FROM(data, 'utf8') AS data
    FROM bytea_source
)
```

`jsonb` data expresses a JSON object similar to [PostgreSQL’s implementation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html).
For more information, see [`jsonb`](/sql/types/jsonb/).
