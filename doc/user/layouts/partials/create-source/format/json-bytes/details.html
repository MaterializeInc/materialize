### Byte format details (JSON)

Materialize receives all data from Kinesis streams as bytes, which you must
convert to [`text`](/sql/types/text), and then to
[`jsonb`](/sql/types/jsonb).

Here is an example of using a Kinesis source, converting the streams bytes into
`jsonb` data:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW jsonified_kinesis_source AS
SELECT CAST(data AS JSONB) AS data
FROM (
    SELECT CONVERT_FROM(data, 'utf8') AS data
    FROM kinesis_source
)
```
