### Protobuf format details

Protobuf-formatted external sources require:

- `FileDescriptorSet`
- Top-level message name

#### `FileDescriptorSet`

The `FileDescriptorSet` encodes the Protobuf messages' schema, which Materialize
needs to decode incoming Protobuf data.

You can generate the `FileDescriptorSet` with `protoc`, e.g.

```shell
protoc --include_imports --descriptor_set_out=billing.pb billing.proto
```

#### Top-level message

Materialize needs to know which message from your `FileDescriptorSet` is the
top-level message to decode, along with its package name, in the following
format:

```shell
<package name>.<top-level message>
```

For example, if our `FileDescriptorSet` were from a `.proto` file in the
`billing` package, and our top-level message was called `Batch`, our
_message&lowbar;name_ value would be:

```nofmt
billing.Batch
```

#### Schema evolution

As long as you follow the [Protobuf rules for backwards-compatible schema
evolution](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview#updating),
you can write messages to your source using a newer version of the schema than
you provided to Materialize when you created the source. Materialize continues
to use the original definition of the schema by mapping values from the new
schema to the old schema as described in the linked document.

To use the new version of the message definition in Materialize, you need to
drop and recreate your source.
