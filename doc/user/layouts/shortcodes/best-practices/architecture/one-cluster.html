If a three-tier architecture is not feasible or unnecessary due to low volume or
a non-production setup, a single cluster may suffice for your sources, compute
objects, and query serving needs.

**Benefits of a single cluster architecture** include:

- Cost effective

**Limitations of a single cluster architecture** include:

- Sources, compute objects, and queries compete for cluster resources.

- [Blue/green
  deployment](/manage/dbt/blue-green-deployments/) is
  unsupported since sources would need to be dropped and recreated, putting strain on your upstream system during source recreation.

  To support blue/green deployments, use a two-cluster architecture by moving
  compute objects to a new cluster (i.e., recreating compute objects in a new cluster).
