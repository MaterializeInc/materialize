If the [recommended three-tier
architecture](/manage/operational-guidelines/#three-tier-architecture)
is infeasible or unnecessary due to low volume or a **non**-production setup, a
one-tier architecture may suffice for your sources, compute objects,
and query serving needs.

**Benefits of a one-tier architecture** include:

- Cost effective

**Limitations of a one-tier architecture** include:

- Sources, compute objects, and queries compete for cluster resources.

- [Blue/green
  deployment](/manage/dbt/blue-green-deployments/) is
  unsupported since sources would need to be dropped and recreated, putting strain on your upstream system during source recreation.

  To support blue/green deployments, use a two-tier architecture by moving
  compute objects to a new cluster (i.e., recreating compute objects in a new cluster).

- Cluster restarts require rehydration of the indexes on views.

- Clusters containing sources or sinks can only have a replication factor of 0
or 1.
