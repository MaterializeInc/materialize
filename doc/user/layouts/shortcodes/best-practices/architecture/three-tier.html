{{ $data := $.Site.Data.best_practices.three_tier_architecture }}

In production, use a three-tier architecture, if feasible. A three-tier
architecture consists of:

{{ partial "yaml-tables/generic-table.html" (dict "rows" $data.rows "columns"
$data.columns) }}

Benefits of a three-tier architecture include:

- Support for [blue/green
  deployments](/manage/dbt/development-workflows/#bluegreen-deployments)

- Independent scaling of each tier.
