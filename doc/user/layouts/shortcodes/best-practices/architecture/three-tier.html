In production, use a three-tier architecture, if feasible.

architecture")

A three-tier architecture consists of:

{{ partial "yaml-tables/generic-table.html" (dict "rows" $data.rows "columns"
$data.columns) }}

Benefits of a three-tier architecture include:

- Support for [blue/green
  deployments](/manage/dbt/blue-green-deployments/)

- Independent scaling of each tier.
