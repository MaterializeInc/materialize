If a three-tier architecture is not feasible or unnecessary due to low volume or
a non-production setup, a two cluster architecture may suffice. A two-cluster architecture consists of:

- **A dedicated cluster** for [sources](/concepts/sources/).

- **A dedicated cluster** for both compute and serving queries.

Benefits of a two-cluster architecture include:

- Support for [blue/green
  deployments](/manage/dbt/development-workflows/#bluegreen-deployments)

- More cost effective than a three-tier architecture.

However, with a two-cluster architecture, compute and queries compete for the
same cluster resources.
