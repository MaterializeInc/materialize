If a three-tier architecture is not feasible or unnecessary due to low volume or
a non-production setup, two cluster architecture may suffice. A two-cluster architecture consists of:

- **A dedicated cluster** for [sources](/concepts/sources/).

- **A dedicated cluster** for both compute and serving queries (including
[sinks](/concepts/sinks/)).

Benefits of a two-tier architecture include:

- Support for [blue/green
  deployments](/manage/dbt/development-workflows/#bluegreen-deployments)

- More cost effective than a three-tier architecture.

However, with a two-tier architecture, compute and queries compete for the same
cluster resources.
