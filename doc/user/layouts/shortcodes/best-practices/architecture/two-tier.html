If the [recommended three-tier
architecture](/manage/operational-guidelines/#three-tier-architecture)
is infeasible or unnecessary due to low volume or a **non**-production setup, a
two-tier architecture may suffice. A two-tier architecture consists of:

![Image of the 2-cluster architecture: Source cluster, Compute/Transform +
Serving cluster](/images/2-tier-architecture.svg)

{{ partial "yaml-tables/generic-table.html" (dict "rows" $data.rows "columns"
$data.columns) }}

Benefits of a two-tier architecture include:

- Support for [blue/green
  deployments](/manage/dbt/blue-green-deployments/)

- More cost effective than a three-tier architecture.

However, with a two-tier architecture:

- Compute/transform operations and queries compete for the same cluster
resources.

- Cluster restarts require rehydration of the indexes on views.

- Clusters containing sources or sinks can only have a replication factor of 0
or 1.
