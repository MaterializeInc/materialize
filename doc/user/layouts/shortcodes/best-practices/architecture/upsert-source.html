In addition:

- Consider separating upsert sources from your other sources. Upsert sources
  have higher resource requirements (since, for upsert sources, Materialize
  maintains each key and associated last value for the key as well as to perform
  deduplication). As such, if possible, use a separate source cluster for upsert
  sources.

- Consider using a larger cluster size during snapshotting for upsert sources.
  Once the snapshotting operation is complete, you can downsize the cluster to
  align with the steady-state ingestion.
