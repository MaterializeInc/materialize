1. Click on a deployment to see the individual deployment view.

1. If you are connecting through Tailscale VPN, go to the Integrations card, then the Tailscale tab. Click **Enable**, then enter the Tailscale auth key in the Tailscale Authentication dialog and click **Save**. The deployment will automatically restart.

    Tailscale integration must enabled separately for each deployment.

    For help generating an auth key, please see the [Tailscale documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1085/auth-keys/). Make sure you create a **one-off key**.

1. In the Connect card, go to the psql tab and click **Download certificates**.

1. Unzip the certificate package.

    The certificate package is named `<deployment-name>.zip` and contains the TLS certificates and keys you need to connect.

1. To connect to the deployment, you can use any [Materialize-compatible CLI](/integrations/psql), like `psql`. If you have `psql` installed on your machine, proceed to the next step.

    Otherwise, follow the [installation instructions](/install/#cli-connections).

1. Open a terminal window on your machine, copy the `psql` command from the connection dialog and run it from the directory that contains the certificates.

    If you're connecting through Tailscale, replace the hostname in the copied command with the address of your Materialize connection in Tailscale.

    On connection success, you should see an **open prompt** waiting for your next commands:

    ```nofmt
    psql (13.2, server 9.5.0)
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher:
    TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.

    materialize=>
    ```
