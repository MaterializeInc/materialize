1. Click the deployment card, then **download** and **unzip** the certificate package.

1. To connect to the deployment, you can use any [Materialize-compatible CLI](/connect/cli), like `psql` or `mzcli`. If you have `psql` installed on your machine, proceed to the next step.

    Otherwise, follow the [installation instructions](/install/#cli-connections).

1. Open a terminal window on your machine, copy the `psql` command from the connection dialog and run it from the directory that contains the certificates.

    On connection success, you should see an **open prompt** waiting for your next commands:

    ```nofmt
    psql (13.2, server 9.5.0)
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher:
    TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.

    materialize=>
    ```
