2. Click the **Connect** button in the same row as the deployment.
3. Click **Download certificates**.
4. Unzip the certificate package.
5. To connect to the deployment with the psql command-line tool, copy the command from the connection dialog and run it from the directory that contains the certificates.

   The sample code below will not work unless you substitute your real hostname.

   ```
   psql "postgresql://materialize@hostname:6875materialize?
   sslcert=materialize.crt&
   sslkey=materialize.key&sslrootcert=ca.crt"
   ```

    If you've just created the deployment, you may need to wait a minute or two before you'll be able to connect.
