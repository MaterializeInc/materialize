2. Click the **Connect** button in the same row as the deployment. It might take a couple of minutes before you're able to connect.
3. Click **Download certificates** and unzip the certificate package.
4. To connect to the deployment, you can use any [Materialize-compatible CLI](/connect/cli), like `psql` or `mzcli`. If you have `psql` installed on your machine, copy the command from the connection dialog and run it from the directory that contains the certificates.

   **Note:** The sample command below will not work unless you replace `hostname` with the one you were provided.

   ```
   psql "postgresql://materialize@hostname:6875materialize?
   sslcert=materialize.crt&
   sslkey=materialize.key&sslrootcert=ca.crt"
   ```

   Otherwise, you can find the steps to install and use your CLI of choice under [Install](/install/#cli-connections).
