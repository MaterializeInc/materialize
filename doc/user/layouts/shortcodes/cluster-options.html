------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------
`SIZE`                              | `text`     | The size of the resource allocations for the cluster. See [Size](/sql/create-cluster#size) for details.
`REPLICATION FACTOR`                | `text`     | The number of replicas to provision for the cluster. See [Replication factor](/sql/create-cluster#replication-factor) for details.<br>Default: `1`
`INTROSPECTION INTERVAL`            | `interval` | The interval at which to collect introspection data. See [Troubleshooting](/ops/troubleshooting) for details about introspection data. The special value `0` entirely disables the gathering of introspection data.<br>Default: `1s`
`INTROSPECTION DEBUGGING`           | `bool`     | Indicates whether to introspect the gathering of the introspection data.<br>Default: `FALSE`
`IDLE ARRANGEMENT MERGE EFFORT`     | `integer`  | ***Unstable.** This option may be changed or removed at any time.*<br>The amount of effort the replica should exert on compacting arrangements during idle periods.
`MANAGED`                           | `bool`     | Whether to automatically manage the cluster's replicas based on the configured size and replication factor. If `FALSE`, enables the use of the deprecated [`CREATE CLUSTER REPLICA`](/sql/create-cluster-replica) command.<br>Default: `TRUE`
