For [window functions](/sql/functions/#window-functions), when an input record
in a partition (as determined by the `PARTITION BY` clause of your window
function) is added/removed/changed, Materialize recomputes the results for the
entire window partition. This means that when a new batch of input data arrives
(that is, every second), **the amount of computation performed is proportional
to the total size of the touched partitions**.

For example, assume that in a given second, 20 input records change, and these
records belong to **10** different partitions, where the average size of each
partition is **100**. Then, amount of work to perform is proportional to
computing the window function results for **10\*100=1000** rows.

To avoid performance issues that may arise as the number of records grows,
consider rewriting your query to use idiomatic Materialize SQL instead of window
functions. If your query cannot be rewritten without the window functions and
the performance of window functions is insufficient for your use case, please
[contact our team](/support/).
