Indexes in Materialize does not order its keys using the data type's natural
ordering and instead orders by its internal representation of the key (the tuple
of key length and value).

As such, indexes in Materialize currently do not provide optimizations for:

- Range queries.

- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses.
