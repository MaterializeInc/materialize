When a new source is created, Materialize performs a sync of all data available
in the upstream Kafka topic before it starts ingesting new data — an operation
known as _snapshotting_. Because the initial snapshot is persisted in the
storage layer atomically (i.e., at the same ingestion timestamp), you
will **not able to query the source until snapshotting is complete**.

In this step, you'll monitor the progress of the initial snapshot using the
observability features in the [Materialize Console](/console/).

1. If not already logged in, [log in to the Materialize Console](/console/).

1. Navigate to **Monitoring** > **Sources** and click through to the source you
   created in the previous step. In the source overview page, you will see a
   progress bar with the status and progress of the snapshot.

1. For the duration of the snapshotting operation, the source status will show
   as `Snapshotting`. Once the source status transitions from `Snapshotting` to
   `Running`, the source is ready for querying and you can move on to the next
   step.

   If the source fails to transition to this state, check the
   [ingestion troubleshooting guide](/ingest-data/troubleshooting/).
