Materialize follows the SQL standard (SQL-92) implementation and aims for
compatibility with the PostgreSQL dialect. It **does not** aim for
compatibility with a specific version of PostgreSQL. This means that
Materialize might support syntax from any released PostgreSQL version, but does
not provide full coverage of the PostgreSQL dialect. The implementation and
performance of specific features (like [window functions](/transform-data/idiomatic-materialize-sql/appendix/window-function-to-materialize))
might also differ, because Materialize uses an entirely different database
engine based on [Timely and Differential Dataflow](/get-started/#incremental-updates).

If you need specific syntax or features that are not currently supported in
Materialize, please submit a [feature request](/support/#requesting-a-feature).
