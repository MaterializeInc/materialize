Materialize exposes [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics at the default
path, `<materialized host>/metrics`.

Materialize broadly publishes the following types of data there:

- Materialize-specific data with a `mz_*` prefix. For example,
  `rate(mz_responses_sent_total[10s])` will show you the number of responses
  averaged over 10 second windows.
- Standard process metrics with a `process_*` prefix. For example, `process_cpu`.
