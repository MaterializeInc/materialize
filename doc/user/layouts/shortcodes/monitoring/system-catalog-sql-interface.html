## System catalog SQL interface

The `mz_catalog` SQL interface provides a variety of ways to introspect Materialize. An
introduction to this catalog is available as part of our [SQL
documentation](/sql/system-catalog).

A user guide for debugging a running `materialized` using the system catalog is available
in the form of a walkthrough of useful [diagnostic queries](/ops/troubleshooting).
