- Make sure you are running MySQL 5.7 or higher. Materialize uses
  [GTID-based binary log (binlog) replication](/sql/create-source-v1/mysql/#change-data-capture),
  which is not available in older versions of MySQL.

- Ensure you have access to your MySQL instance via the [`mysql` client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html),
  or your preferred SQL client.
