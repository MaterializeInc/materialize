Once GTID-based binlog replication is enabled, we recommend creating a dedicated
user for Materialize with sufficient privileges to manage replication.

1. As a _superuser_, use `mysql` (or your preferred SQL client) to connect to
   your database.

1. Create a dedicated user for Materialize, if you don't already have one:

   ```mysql
   CREATE USER 'materialize'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

   ALTER USER 'materialize'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;
   ```

1. Grant the user permission to manage replication:

   ```mysql
   GRANT SELECT, RELOAD, SHOW DATABASES, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, LOCK TABLES ON *.* TO 'materialize'@'%';
   ```

   Once connected to your database, Materialize will take an initial snapshot of
   the tables in your MySQL server. `SELECT` privileges are required for this
   initial snapshot.

1. Apply the changes:

   ```mysql
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```
