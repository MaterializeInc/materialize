1. In the [SQL Shell](/console/), or your preferred SQL
   client connected to Materialize, use the [`CREATE SECRET`](/sql/create-secret/)
   command to securely store the password for the `materialize` MySQL user
   you created [earlier](#2-create-a-user-for-replication):

    ```mzsql
    CREATE SECRET mysqlpass AS '<PASSWORD>';
    ```

    For AWS IAM authentication, you must create a connection to AWS.  See the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/#aws) command for details.

1. Use the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/) command to create a
   connection object with access and authentication details for Materialize to
   use:

    ```mzsql
    CREATE CONNECTION mysql_connection TO MYSQL (
        HOST <host>,
        PORT 3306,
        USER 'materialize',
        PASSWORD SECRET mysqlpass,
        SSL MODE REQUIRED
    );
    ```

    - Replace `<host>` with your MySQL endpoint.

    AWS IAM authentication is also available, see the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/#mysql) command for details.
