1. In the [SQL Shell](https://console.materialize.com/), or your preferred SQL
client connected to Materialize, use the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/#aws-privatelink)
command to create an AWS PrivateLink connection:

    ↕️ **In-region connections**

    To connect to an AWS PrivateLink endpoint service in the **same region** as your
    Materialize environment:

      ```mzsql
      CREATE CONNECTION privatelink_svc TO AWS PRIVATELINK (
        SERVICE NAME 'com.amazonaws.vpce.<region_id>.vpce-svc-<endpoint_service_id>',
        AVAILABILITY ZONES ('use1-az1', 'use1-az2', 'use1-az4')
      );
      ```

    - Replace the `SERVICE NAME` value with the service name you noted [earlier](#b-optional-configure-network-security).

    - Replace the `AVAILABILITY ZONES` list with the IDs of the availability
      zones in your AWS account. For in-region connections the availability
      zones of the NLB and the consumer VPC **must match**.

      To find your availability zone IDs, select your database in the RDS
      Console and click the subnets under **Connectivity & security**. For each
      subnet, look for **Availability Zone ID** (e.g., `use1-az6`),
      not **Availability Zone** (e.g., `us-east-1d`).

    ↔️ **Cross-region connections**

    To connect to an AWS PrivateLink endpoint service in a **different region** to
    the one where your Materialize environment is deployed:

      ```mzsql
      CREATE CONNECTION privatelink_svc TO AWS PRIVATELINK (
        SERVICE NAME 'com.amazonaws.vpce.us-west-1.vpce-svc-<endpoint_service_id>',
        -- For now, the AVAILABILITY ZONES clause **is** required, but will be
        -- made optional in a future release.
        AVAILABILITY ZONES ()
      );
      ```

    - Replace the `SERVICE NAME` value with the service name you noted [earlier](#b-optional-configure-network-security).

    - The service name region refers to where the endpoint service was created.
      You **do not need** to specify `AVAILABILITY ZONES` manually — these will
      be optimally auto-assigned when none are provided.

1. Retrieve the AWS principal for the AWS PrivateLink connection you just
created:

     ```mzsql
     SELECT principal
       FROM mz_aws_privatelink_connections plc
       JOIN mz_connections c ON plc.id = c.id
       WHERE c.name = 'privatelink_svc';
     ```
    <p></p>

    ```
    principal
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    arn:aws:iam::664411391173:role/mz_20273b7c-2bbe-42b8-8c36-8cc179e9bbc3_u1
    ```

1. Update your VPC endpoint service to [accept connections from the AWS
principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/add-endpoint-service-permissions.html).

1. If your AWS PrivateLink service is configured to require acceptance of
connection requests, [manually approve the connection request from
Materialize](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/configure-endpoint-service.html#accept-reject-connection-requests).

    **Note:** It can take some time for the connection request to show up. Do
    not move on to the next step until you've approved the connection.

1. Validate the AWS PrivateLink connection you created using the
[`VALIDATE CONNECTION`](/sql/validate-connection) command:

    ```mzsql
    VALIDATE CONNECTION privatelink_svc;
    ```

    If no validation error is returned, move to the next step.

1. Use the [`CREATE SECRET`](/sql/create-secret/) command to securely store the
password for the `materialize` MySQL user you created [earlier](#2-create-a-user-for-replication):

    ```mzsql
    CREATE SECRET mysqlpass AS '<PASSWORD>';
    ```

1. Use the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/) command to create
another connection object, this time with database access and authentication
details for Materialize to use:

    ```mzsql
    CREATE CONNECTION mysql_connection TO MYSQL (
    HOST <host>,
      PORT 3306,
      USER 'materialize',
      PASSWORD SECRET mysqlpass,
      SSL MODE REQUIRED,
      AWS PRIVATELINK privatelink_svc
    );
    ```

    - Replace `<host>` with your RDS endpoint. To find your RDS endpoint, select
      your database in the RDS Console, and look under **Connectivity &
      security**.

      - Replace `<database>` with the name of the database containing the tables
        you want to replicate to Materialize.

        1. Use the [`CREATE SOURCE`](/sql/create-source/) command to connect Materialize
        to your RDS instance via AWS PrivateLink and start ingesting data:

        ```mzsql
        CREATE SOURCE mz_source
        FROM mysql CONNECTION mysql_connection
        FOR ALL TABLES;
        ```

        By default, the source will be created in the active cluster; to use a
        different cluster, use the `IN CLUSTER` clause. To ingest data from
        specific schemas or tables, use `FOR SCHEMAS(<schema1>,<schema2>)` or `FOR
            TABLES (<table1>, <table2>)` instead of `FOR ALL TABLES`.
