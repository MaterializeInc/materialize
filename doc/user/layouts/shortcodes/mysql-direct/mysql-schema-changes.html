Materialize supports schema changes in the upstream MySQL database as
follows:

#### Compatible schema changes

- Adding columns to tables. Materialize will **not ingest** these columns unless
  you drop and recreate the source.

- Dropping columns that were added after the source was created. These columns
  are never ingested, so you can drop them without issue.

- Adding or removing `NOT NULL` constraints to tables that were nullable when
  the source was created.

#### Incompatible schema changes

All other schema changes to tables in MySQL will set the corresponding subsource
into an error state, which prevents you from reading from the source.

To handle incompatible [schema changes](#schema-changes), use [`DROP SOURCE`](/sql/drop-source/)
to drop and recreate the source. Support for dropping and recreating individual
subsources is planned for a future release.
