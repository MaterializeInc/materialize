After the snapshotting phase, Materialize starts ingesting change events from
the MySQL replication stream. For this work, Materialize generally
performs well with an `xsmall` replica, so you can resize the cluster
accordingly.

1. Still in a SQL client connected to Materialize, use the [`ALTER CLUSTER`](/sql/alter-cluster/)
   command to downsize the cluster to `xsmall`:

    ```sql
    ALTER CLUSTER ingest_mysql SET (SIZE 'xsmall');
    ```

    Behind the scenes, this command adds a new `xsmall` replica and removes the
    `small` replica.

1. Use the [`SHOW CLUSTER REPLICAS`](/sql/show-cluster-replicas/) command to
   check the status of the new replica:

    ```sql
    SHOW CLUSTER REPLICAS WHERE cluster = 'ingest_mysql';
    ```
    <p></p>

    ```nofmt
         cluster     | replica |  size  | ready
    -----------------+---------+--------+-------
     ingest_mysql    | r1      | xsmall | t
    (1 row)
    ```
