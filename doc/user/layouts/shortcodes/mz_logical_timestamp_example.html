For this example, you'll need to create a sample data source and create a materialized view from it for later reference.

```sql
--Create table
CREATE TABLE events (
    content text,
    insert_ts numeric,
    delete_ts numeric
);
--Create materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW valid AS
SELECT content, insert_ts, delete_ts
FROM events
WHERE mz_logical_timestamp() >= insert_ts
  AND mz_logical_timestamp()  < delete_ts;
```

Next, you'll populate the table with timestamp data. The epoch extracted from `now()` is measured in seconds, so it's multiplied by 1000 to match the milliseconds in `mz_logical_timestamp()`.

```sql
INSERT INTO events VALUES (
    'hello',
    extract(epoch from now()) * 1000,
    (extract(epoch from now()) * 1000) + 100000
);
INSERT INTO events VALUES (
    'welcome',
    extract(epoch from now()) * 1000,
    (extract(epoch from now()) * 1000) + 150000
);
INSERT INTO events VALUES (
    'goodbye',
    (extract(epoch from now()) * 1000),
    (extract(epoch from now()) * 1000) + 200000
);
```

Then, before 100,000 ms (or 1.67 minutes) elapse, run the following query to see all the records:

```sql
SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
```
```nofmt
content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1620853325858 | 1620853425858 |        1620853337180
 goodbye | 1620853325862 | 1620853525862 |        1620853337180
 welcome | 1620853325860 | 1620853475860 |        1620853337180
(3 rows)
```

If you run the query again after 1.67 minutes, you'll see only two results, because the first result has aged out of the view.
