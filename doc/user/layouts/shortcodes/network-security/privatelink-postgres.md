1. #### Create target groups
    Create a dedicated [target group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-target-group.html) for your RDS instance with the following details:

    a. Target type as **IP address**.

    b. Protocol as **TCP**.

    c. Port as **5432**, or the port that you are using in case it is not 5432.

    d. Make sure that the target group is in the same VPC as the RDS instance.

    e. Click next, and register the respective RDS instance to the target group using its IP address.

1. #### Verify security groups and health checks

    Once the target groups have been created, make sure that the [health checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-health-checks.html) are passing and that the targets are reported as healthy.

    If you have set up a security group for your RDS instance, you must ensure that it allows traffic on the health check port.

    **Remarks**:

    a. Network Load Balancers do not have associated security groups. Therefore, the security groups for your targets must use IP addresses to allow traffic.

    b. You can't use the security groups for the clients as a source in the security groups for the targets. Therefore, the security groups for your targets must use the IP addresses of the clients to allow traffic. For more details, check the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-register-targets.html).

1. #### Create a Network Load Balancer (NLB)
    Create a [Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-network-load-balancer.html) that is **enabled for the same subnets** that the RDS instance is in.

1. #### Create TCP listeners

    Create a [TCP listener](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-listener.html) for your RDS instance that forwards to the corresponding target group you created.

1. #### Create a VPC endpoint service

    Create a VPC [endpoint service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-endpoint-service.html) and associate it with the **Network Load Balancer** that youâ€™ve just created.

    Note the **service name** that is generated for the endpoint service.

1. #### Create an AWS PrivateLink Connection
     In Materialize, create an [AWS PrivateLink connection](/sql/create-connection/#aws-privatelink) that references the endpoint service that you created in the previous step.

     ```sql
    CREATE CONNECTION privatelink_svc TO AWS PRIVATELINK (
        SERVICE NAME 'com.amazonaws.vpce.<region_id>.vpce-svc-<endpoint_service_id>',
        AVAILABILITY ZONES ('use1-az1', 'use1-az2', 'use1-az3')
    );
    ```

    Update the list of the availability zones to match the ones that you are using in your AWS account.

## Configure the AWS PrivateLink service

1. Retrieve the AWS principal for the AWS PrivateLink connection you just created:

    ```sql
    SELECT principal
    FROM mz_aws_privatelink_connections plc
    JOIN mz_connections c ON plc.id = c.id
    WHERE c.name = 'privatelink_svc';
    ```

    ```
       id   |                                 principal
    --------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     u1     | arn:aws:iam::664411391173:role/mz_20273b7c-2bbe-42b8-8c36-8cc179e9bbc3_u1
    ```

    Follow the instructions in the [AWS PrivateLink documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/add-endpoint-service-permissions.html)
    to configure your VPC endpoint service to accept connections from the
    provided AWS principal.

1. If your AWS PrivateLink service is configured to require acceptance of connection requests, you must manually approve the connection request from Materialize after executing `CREATE CONNECTION`. For more details, check the [AWS PrivateLink documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/configure-endpoint-service.html#accept-reject-connection-requests).

    **Note:** It might take some time for the endpoint service connection to show up, so you would need to wait for the endpoint service connection to be ready before you create a source.

## Validate the AWS PrivateLink connection

Validate the AWS PrivateLink connection you created using the [`VALIDATE CONNECTION`](/sql/validate-connection) command:

```sql
VALIDATE CONNECTION privatelink_svc;
```

If no validation error is returned, move to the next step.

## Create a source connection

In Materialize, create a source connection that uses the AWS PrivateLink connection you just configured:

```sql
CREATE CONNECTION pg_connection TO POSTGRES (
    HOST 'instance.foo000.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com',
    PORT 5432,
    DATABASE postgres,
    USER postgres,
    PASSWORD SECRET pgpass,
    AWS PRIVATELINK privatelink_svc
);
```

This PostgreSQL connection can then be reused across multiple [CREATE SOURCE](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/postgres/) statements:

```sql
CREATE SOURCE mz_source
  FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION pg_connection (PUBLICATION 'mz_source')
  FOR ALL TABLES;
```
