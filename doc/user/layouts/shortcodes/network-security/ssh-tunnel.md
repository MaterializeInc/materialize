Materialize can connect to data sources like Kafka, Confluent, and PostgreSQL with a
secure SSH bastion host. In this guide, you will create an SSH tunnel
connection, configure your Materialize authentication settings, and create a
source connection.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you have access to a bastion host. You will need:

* The bastion host IP address and port number
* The bastion host username

## Create an SSH tunnel connection

In Materialize, create an [SSH tunnel connection](/sql/create-connection/#ssh-tunnel) to the bastion host:

```sql
CREATE CONNECTION ssh_connection TO SSH TUNNEL (
    HOST '<SSH_BASTION_HOST>',
    USER '<SSH_BASTION_USER>',
    PORT <SSH_BASTION_PORT>
);
```

## Configure the SSH bastion host

The bastion host needs a **public key** to connect to the Materialize tunnel you
created in the previous step.

1. Materialize stores public keys for SSH tunnels in the system catalog. Query [`mz_ssh_tunnel_connections`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_catalog/#mz_ssh_tunnel_connections) to retrieve the public keys for the SSH tunnel connection you just created:

    ```sql
    SELECT
        mz_connections.name,
        mz_ssh_tunnel_connections.*
    FROM
        mz_connections JOIN
        mz_ssh_tunnel_connections USING(id)
    WHERE
        mz_connections.name = 'ssh_connection';
    ```

    ```
    | id    | public_key_1                          | public_key_2                          |
    |-------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    | u75   | ssh-ed25519 AAAA...76RH materialize   | ssh-ed25519 AAAA...hLYV materialize   |
    ```


    > Materialize provides two public keys to allow you to rotate keys without
    connection downtime. Review the [`ALTER CONNECTION`](/sql/alter-connection) documentation for
    more information on how to rotate your keys.

1. Log in to your SSH bastion server and add each key to the bastion `authorized_keys` file:

    ```bash
    # Command for Linux
    echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAA...76RH materialize" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAA...hLYV materialize" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

3. Configure your internal firewall to allow the SSH bastion host to connect to your Kafka cluster or PostgreSQL instance.

    If you are using a cloud provider like AWS or GCP, update the security group or firewall rules for your PostgreSQL instance or Kafka brokers.

    Allow incoming traffic from the SSH bastion host IP address on the necessary ports.

    For example, use port `5432` for PostgreSQL and ports `9092`, `9094`, and `9096` for Kafka.

    Test the connection from the bastion host to the Kafka cluster or PostgreSQL instance.

    ```bash
    telnet <KAFKA_BROKER_HOST> <KAFKA_BROKER_PORT>
    telnet <POSTGRES_HOST> <POSTGRES_PORT>
    ```

    If the command hangs, double-check your security group and firewall settings. If the connection is successful, you can proceed to the next step.

4. Verify the SSH tunnel connection from your source to your bastion host:

    ```bash
    # Command for Linux
    ssh -L 9092:kafka-broker:9092 <SSH_BASTION_USER>@<SSH_BASTION_HOST>
    ```

    Verify that you can connect to the Kafka broker or PostgreSQL instance via the SSH tunnel:

    ```bash
    telnet localhost 9092
    ```

    If you are unable to connect using the `telnet` command, enable `AllowTcpForwarding` and `PermitTunnel` on your bastion host SSH configuration file.

    On your SSH bastion host, open the SSH config file (usually located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) using a text editor:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```

    Add or uncomment the following lines:

    ```bash
    AllowTcpForwarding yes
    PermitTunnel yes
    ```

    Save the changes and restart the SSH service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart sshd
    ```

5. Retrieve the static egress IPs from Materialize and configure the firewall rules (e.g. AWS Security Groups) for your bastion host to allow SSH traffic for those IP addresses only.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM mz_catalog.mz_egress_ips;
    ```

    ```
    XXX.140.90.33
    XXX.198.159.213
    XXX.100.27.23
    ```

## Validate the SSH tunnel connection

To confirm that the SSH tunnel connection is correctly configured, use the [`VALIDATE CONNECTION`](/sql/validate-connection) command:

```sql
VALIDATE CONNECTION ssh_connection;
```

If no validation errors are returned, the connection can be used to create a source connection.
