- Make sure you are running a [supported version of PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).

- Make sure [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) is installed on your workstation.

  You'll use `psql` to interact with your PostgreSQL database and with Materialize.

- Make sure there are no schema changes planned or in progress on the tables that you want to replicate.
