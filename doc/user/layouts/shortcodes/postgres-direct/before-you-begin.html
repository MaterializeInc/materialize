- Make sure you are running PostgreSQL 11 or higher.

- Make sure you have access to your PostgreSQL instance via a SQL client (e.g. [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html)).

You'll use the [Materialize SQL shell](https://console.materialize.com/), or your preferred SQL client, to interact with Materialize.
