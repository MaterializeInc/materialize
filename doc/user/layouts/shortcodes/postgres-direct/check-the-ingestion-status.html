Before it starts consuming the replication stream, Materialize takes a snapshot of the relevant tables in your publication. Until this snapshot is complete, Materialize won't have the same view of your data as your PostgreSQL database.

In this step, you'll first verify that the source is running and then check the status of the snapshotting process.

1. Back in the `psql` shell connected to Materialize, use the [`mz_source_statuses`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_source_statuses) table to check the overall status of your source:

    ```sql
    WITH
      source_id AS
      (SELECT id FROM mz_objects WHERE name = 'mz_source')
    SELECT *
    FROM
      mz_internal.mz_source_statuses
        JOIN
          (
            SELECT referenced_object_id
            FROM mz_internal.mz_object_dependencies
            WHERE
              object_id = (SELECT id FROM source_id)
            UNION SELECT id FROM source_id
          )
          AS sources
        ON mz_source_statuses.id = sources.referenced_object_id;
    ```

    For each `subsource`, make sure the `status` is `running`. If you see `stalled` or `failed`, there's likely a configuration issue for you to fix. Check the `error` field for details and fix the issue before moving on. Also, if the `status` of any subsource is `starting` for more than a few minutes, [contact our team](/support/).

2. Once the source is running, use the [`mz_source_statistics`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_source_statistics) table to check the status of the initial snapshot:

    ```sql
    WITH
      source_id AS
      (SELECT id FROM mz_objects WHERE name = 'mz_source')
    SELECT bool_and(snapshot_committed) AS snapshot_committed
    FROM
      mz_internal.mz_source_statistics
        JOIN
          (
            SELECT referenced_object_id
            FROM mz_internal.mz_object_dependencies
            WHERE
              object_id = (SELECT id FROM source_id)
            UNION SELECT id FROM source_id
          )
          AS sources
        ON mz_source_statistics.id = sources.referenced_object_id;
    ```
    <p></p>

    ```nofmt
     snapshot_committed
    --------------------
     t
    (1 row)
    ```

    Once `snapshot_commited` is `t`, move on to the next step. Snapshotting can take between a few minutes to several hours, depending on the size of your dataset and the size of the cluster replica you chose for your `ingest_postgres` cluster.
