In Materialize, a [cluster](/get-started/key-concepts/#clusters) is an isolated environment, similar to a virtual warehouse in Snowflake. When you create a cluster, you choose the size of its physical compute resource (i.e., [replica](/get-started/key-concepts/#cluster-replicas)) based on the work you need the cluster to do, whether ingesting data from a source, computing always-up-to-date query results, serving results to clients, or a combination.

In this case, you'll create 1 new cluster containing 1 `medium` replica for ingesting source data from your PostgreSQL database.

1. In the `psql` shell connected to Materialize, use the [`CREATE CLUSTER`](/sql/create-cluster/) command to create the new cluster:

    ```sql
    CREATE CLUSTER ingest_postgres SIZE = 'medium';
    ```

    We recommend starting with a `medium` [size](/sql/create-cluster-replica/#sizes) replica or larger. This will help Materialize more quickly process the initial snapshot of the tables in your publication. Once the snapshot is finished, you'll right-size the cluster.
