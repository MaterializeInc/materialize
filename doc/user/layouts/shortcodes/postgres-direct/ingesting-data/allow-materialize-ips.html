1. In a SQL client connected to Materialize, use the [`CREATE SECRET`](/sql/create-secret/)
   command to securely store the password for the `materialize` PostgreSQL user you
   created [earlier](#step-2-create-a-publication):

    ```sql
    CREATE SECRET pgpass AS '<PASSWORD>';
    ```

1. Use the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/) command to create a
   connection object with access and authentication details for Materialize to
   use:

    ```sql
    CREATE CONNECTION pg_connection TO POSTGRES (
      HOST '<host>',
      PORT 5432,
      USER 'materialize',
      PASSWORD SECRET pgpass,
      SSL MODE 'require',
      DATABASE '<database>'
      );
    ```

    - Replace `<host>` with your Postgres endpoint.

    - Replace `<database>` with the name of the database containing the tables
      you want to replicate to Materialize.

1. Use the [`CREATE SOURCE`](/sql/create-source/) command to connect Materialize
to your Postgres instance and start ingesting data from the publication you
created [earlier](#step-2-create-a-publication):

    ```sql
    CREATE SOURCE mz_source
      IN CLUSTER ingest_postgres
      FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION pg_connection (PUBLICATION 'mz_source')
      FOR ALL TABLES;
    ```

    By default, the source will be created in the active cluster; to use a
    different cluster, use the `IN CLUSTER` clause. To ingest data from
    specific schemas or tables in your publication, use `FOR SCHEMAS
    (<schema1>,<schema2>)` or `FOR TABLES (<table1>, <table2>)` instead of `FOR
    ALL TABLES`.

1. After source creation, you can handle upstream [schema changes](/sql/create-source/postgres/#schema-changes)
   for specific replicated tables using the [`ALTER SOURCE...{ADD | DROP SUBSOURCE`](/sql/alter-source/#context)
   syntax.
