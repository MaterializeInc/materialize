1. In a SQL client connected to Materialize, use the [`CREATE SECRET`](/sql/create-secret/)
   command to securely store the password for the `materialize` PostgreSQL user you
   created [earlier](#2-create-a-publication-and-a-replication-user):

    ```mzsql
    CREATE SECRET pgpass AS '<PASSWORD>';
    ```

1. Use the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/) command to create a
   connection object with access and authentication details for Materialize to
   use:

    ```mzsql
    CREATE CONNECTION pg_connection TO POSTGRES (
      HOST '<host>',
      PORT 5432,
      USER 'materialize',
      PASSWORD SECRET pgpass,
      SSL MODE 'require',
      DATABASE '<database>'
      );
    ```

    - Replace `<host>` with your PostgreSQL endpoint.

    - Replace `<database>` with the name of the database containing the tables
      you want to replicate to Materialize.
