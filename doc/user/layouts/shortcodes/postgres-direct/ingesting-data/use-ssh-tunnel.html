1. In the SQL client connected to Materialize, use the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/#ssh-tunnel) command to create an SSH tunnel connection:

    ```sql
    CREATE CONNECTION ssh_connection TO SSH TUNNEL (
        HOST '<SSH_BASTION_HOST>',
        PORT <SSH_BASTION_PORT>,
        USER '<SSH_BASTION_USER>'
    );
    ```

    - Replace `<SSH_BASTION_HOST>` and `<SSH_BASTION_PORT`> with the public IP address and port of the SSH bastion host you created [earlier](#step-3-configure-network-security).
    - Replace `<SSH_BASTION_USER>` with the username for the key pair you created for your SSH bastion host.

1. Get Materialize's public keys for the SSH tunnel connection:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM mz_ssh_tunnel_connections;
    ```

1. Log in to your SSH bastion host and add Materialize's public keys to the `authorized_keys` file, for example:

    ```sh
    # Command for Linux
    echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAA...76RH materialize" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAA...hLYV materialize" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

1. Back in the SQL client connected to Materialize, validate the SSH tunnel connection you created using the [`VALIDATE CONNECTION`](/sql/validate-connection) command:

    ```sql
    VALIDATE CONNECTION ssh_connection;
    ```

    If no validation error is returned, move to the next step.

1. Use the [`CREATE SECRET`](/sql/create-secret/) command to securely store the password for the `materialize` PostgreSQL user you created [earlier](#step-2-create-a-publication):

    ```sql
    CREATE SECRET pgpass AS '<PASSWORD>';
    ```

1. Use the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/) command to create another connection object, this time with database access and authentication details for Materialize to use:

    ```sql
    CREATE CONNECTION pg_connection TO POSTGRES (
      HOST '<host>',
      PORT 5432,
      USER 'materialize',
      PASSWORD SECRET pgpass,
      DATABASE '<database>',
      SSH TUNNEL ssh_connection
      );
    ```

    - Replace `<host>` with your Postgres endpoint.

    - Replace `<database>` with the name of the database containing the tables you want to replicate to Materialize.

1. Use the [`CREATE SOURCE`](/sql/create-source/) command to connect Materialize to your Azure instance and start ingesting data from the publication you created [earlier](#step-2-create-a-publication):

    ```sql
    CREATE SOURCE mz_source
      IN CLUSTER ingest_postgres
      FROM POSTGRES CONNECTION pg_connection (PUBLICATION 'mz_source')
      FOR ALL TABLES;
    ```

    To ingest data from specific schemas or tables in your publication, use `FOR SCHEMAS (<schema1>,<schema2>)` or `FOR TABLES (<table1>, <table2>)` instead of `FOR ALL TABLES`.
