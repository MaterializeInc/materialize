With Materialize ingesting your PostgreSQL data into durable storage, you can start exploring the data, computing real-time results that stay up-to-date as new data arrives, and serving results efficiently.

- Explore your data with [`SHOW SOURCES`](/sql/show-sources) and [`SELECT`](/sql/select/).
- Compute real-time results in memory with [`CREATE VIEW`](/sql/create-view/) and [`CREATE INDEX`](/sql/create-index/) or in durable storage with [`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`](/sql/create-materialized-view/).
- Serve results to a PostgreSQL-compatible SQL client or driver with [`SELECT`](/sql/select/) or [`SUBSCRIBE`](/sql/subscribe/) or to an external message broker with [`CREATE SINK`](/sql/create-sink/).
- Check out the [tools and integrations](/integrations/) supported by Materialize.
