Materialize supports changes to PostgreSQL sources' ingested tables (known as
"subsources") in the following ways:

#### Compatible schema changes

- Adding columns to tables. Materialize will not ingest these columns.
- Dropping columns that were added after the source was created. These columns
are never ingested, so can be dropped without issue.
- Adding or removing `NOT NULL` constraints to tables that were nullable when
the source was created.

#### Incompatible schema changes

- All other changes to tables' schemas are considered "definite errors," and
Materialize will prevent you from reading from the subsource after it detects
this change occurred.

However, if you make an incompatible schema change to a subsource's upstream
table, you use use [`ALTER SOURCE`](/sql/alter-source/) to first drop the
subsource (`DROP SUBSOURCE`), and then add it back to the source (`ADD
SUBSOURCE`). When you add the subsource, it will have the Postgres table's
current schema.
