Materialize supports schema changes in the upstream PostgreSQL database as
follows:

#### Compatible schema changes

- Adding columns to tables. Materialize will **not ingest** these columns unless
  you use [`ALTER SOURCE...{DROP | ADD} SUBSOURCE`](/sql/alter-source/) to
  first drop the affected subsource, and then add the table back to the
  source.

- Dropping columns that were added after the source was created. These columns
  are never ingested, so you can drop them without issue.

- Adding or removing `NOT NULL` constraints to tables that were nullable when
  the source was created.

#### Incompatible schema changes

All other schema changes to tables in the publication will set the corresponding
subsource into an error state, which prevents you from reading from the
subsource(s).

To handle incompatible [schema changes](#schema-changes), use [`ALTER SOURCE...{DROP | ADD} SUBSOURCE`](/sql/alter-source/)
to first drop the affected subsource, and then add the table back to the source.
When you add the subsource, it will have the updated schema from the
corresponding upstream table.
