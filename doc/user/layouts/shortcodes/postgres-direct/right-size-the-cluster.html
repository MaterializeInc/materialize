After the snapshotting phase, Materialize starts ingesting change events from the PostgreSQL replication stream. For this work, Materialize generally performs well with an `xsmall` replica, so you can resize the cluster accordingly.

1. Still in the `psql` shell connected to Materialize, use the [`ALTER CLUSTER`](/sql/alter-cluster/) command to downsize the cluster to `xsmall`:

    ```sql
    ALTER CLUSTER ingest_postgres SET (SIZE 'xsmall');
    ```

    Behind the scenes, this command adds a new `xsmall` replica and removes the `medium` replica.

1. Use the [`SHOW CLUSTER REPLICAS`](/sql/show-cluster-replicas/) command to check the status of the new replica:

    ```sql
    SHOW CLUSTER REPLICAS WHERE cluster = 'ingest_postgres';
    ```
    <p></p>

    ```nofmt
         cluster     | replica |  size  | ready
    -----------------+---------+--------+-------
     ingest_postgres | r1      | xsmall | t
    (1 row)
    ```

1. Going forward, you can verify that your new replica size is sufficient as follows:

    1. In Materialize, get the replication slot name associated with your PostgreSQL source from the [`mz_internal.mz_postgres_sources`](/sql/system-catalog/mz_internal/#mz_postgres_sources) table:

        ```sql
        SELECT
            d.name AS database_name,
            n.name AS schema_name,
            s.name AS source_name,
            pgs.replication_slot
        FROM
            mz_sources AS s
            JOIN mz_internal.mz_postgres_sources AS pgs ON s.id = pgs.id
            JOIN mz_schemas AS n ON n.id = s.schema_id
            JOIN mz_databases AS d ON d.id = n.database_id;
        ```

    1. In PostgreSQL, check the replication slot lag, using the replication slot name from the previous step:

        ```sql
        SELECT
            pg_size_pretty(pg_current_wal_lsn() - confirmed_flush_lsn)
            AS replication_lag_bytes
        FROM pg_replication_slots
        WHERE slot_name = '<slot_name>';
        ```

        The result of this query is the amount of data your PostgreSQL cluster must retain in its replication log because of this replication slot. Typically, this means Materialize has not yet communicated back to PostgreSQL that it has committed this data. A high value can indicate that the source has fallen behind and that you might need to scale up your ingestion cluster.
