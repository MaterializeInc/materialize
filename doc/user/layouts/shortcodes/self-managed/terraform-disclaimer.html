The sample Terraform module is for **evaluation purposes only** and not intended
for production use. It is provided to help you get started with Materialize for
evaluation purposes only. Materialize does not support nor recommends this
module for production use. Materialize does not guarantee tests for changes to
the module.

For simplicity, this tutorial stores various secrets in a file as well as print
to the terminal. In practice, refer to your organization's official security and
Terraform/infrastructure practices.
