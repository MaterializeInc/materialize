The Terraform modules used in this tutorial are intended for
evaluation/demonstration purposes and for serving as a template when building
your own production deployment. The modules should not be directly relied upon
for production deployments: **future releases of the modules will contain
breaking changes.** Instead, to use as a starting point for your own production
deployment, either:

- Fork the repo and pin to a specific version; or

- Use the code as a reference when developing your own deployment.
