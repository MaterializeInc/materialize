The Terraform modules used in this tutorial are provided for
demonstration/evaluation purposes only. They are not intended for production use
and are not guaranteed to be backwards-compatible; Materialize does not support
nor recommends the modules for production use.

Instead, the repository can be forked and act as a starting point for building
your own production infrastructure.
