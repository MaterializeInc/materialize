To help you get started with Materialize for evaluation purposes, Materialize
provides a sample Terraform module. The sample Terraform module is for
**evaluation purposes only** and not intended for production use. Materialize
does not support nor recommends this module for production use.

For simplicity, this tutorial stores various secrets in a file as well as prints
them to the terminal. In practice, refer to your organization's official
security and Terraform/infrastructure practices.
