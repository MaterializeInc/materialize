If you experience long loading screens or unresponsiveness in the Materialize
Console, we recommend increasing the size of the `mz_catalog_server` cluster.
Refer to the [Troubleshooting Console
Unresponsiveness](/self-managed/installation/troubleshooting/#troubleshooting-console-unresponsiveness)
guide.
