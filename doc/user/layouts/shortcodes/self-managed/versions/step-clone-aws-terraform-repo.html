1. Fork the [Materialize's sample Terraform
   repo](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/terraform-aws-materialize).

1. Clone your forked repo and checkout the `v0.2.7` tag. For example,

   - If cloning via SSH (substitute `your-organization` with your organization's
     name):

     ```bash
     git clone --depth 1 -b v0.2.7 git@github.com:your-organization/terraform-aws-materialize.git
     ```

   - If cloning via HTTPS (substitute `your-organization` with your
     organization's name):

     ```bash
     git clone --depth 1 -b v0.2.7 https://github.com/your-organization/terraform-aws-materialize.git
     ```
