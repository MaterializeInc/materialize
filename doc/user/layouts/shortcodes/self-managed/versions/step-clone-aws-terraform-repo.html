{{ $aws_version := site.Data.self_managed.latest_versions.terraform_aws_version }}

1. Fork the [Materialize's sample Terraform
   repo](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/terraform-aws-materialize).

1. Set `MY_ORGANIZATION` to your github organization name, substituting your
   organization's name for `<enter-your-organization>`:

   ```bash
   MY_ORGANIZATION=<enter-your-organization>
   ```

1. Clone your forked repo and checkout the `{{ $aws_version }}` tag. For example,

   - If cloning via SSH (replace `YOUR_ORGANIZATION` with your organization's
     name):

     ```bash
     git clone --depth 1 -b {{ $aws_version }} git@github.com:${MY_ORGANIZATION}/terraform-aws-materialize.git
     ```

   - If cloning via HTTPS (replace `YOUR_ORGANIZATION` with your
     organization's name):

     ```bash
     git clone --depth 1 -b {{ $aws_version }} https://github.com/${MY_ORGANIZATION}/terraform-aws-materialize.git
     ```
