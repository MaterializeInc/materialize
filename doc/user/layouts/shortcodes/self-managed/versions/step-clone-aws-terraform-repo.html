1. Fork the [Materialize's sample Terraform
   repo](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/terraform-aws-materialize).

1. Set `MY_ORGANIZATION` to your github organization name, substituting your
   organization's name for `<enter-your-organization>`:

   ```bash
   MY_ORGANIZATION=<enter-your-organization>
   ```

1. Clone your forked repo and checkout the `v0.3.2` tag. For example,

   - If cloning via SSH (replace `YOUR_ORGANIZATION` with your organization's
     name):

     ```bash
     git clone --depth 1 -b v0.3.2 git@github.com:${MY_ORGANIZATION}/terraform-aws-materialize.git
     ```

   - If cloning via HTTPS (replace `YOUR_ORGANIZATION` with your
     organization's name):

     ```bash
     git clone --depth 1 -b v0.3.2 https://github.com/${MY_ORGANIZATION}/terraform-aws-materialize.git
     ```
