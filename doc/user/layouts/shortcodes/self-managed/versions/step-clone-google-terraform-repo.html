1. Fork the [Materialize's sample Terraform
   repo](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/terraform-google-materialize).

1. Set `MY_ORGANIZATION` to your github organization name (to be used during
cloning):

   ```bash
   MY_ORGANIZATION=your-organization
   ```

1. Clone your forked repo and checkout the `v0.2.0` tag. For example,

   - If cloning via SSH :

     ```bash
     git clone --depth 1 -b v0.2.0 git@github.com:${MY_ORGANIZATION}/terraform-google-materialize.git
     ```

   - If cloning via HTTPS:

     ```bash
     git clone --depth 1 -b v0.2.0 https://github.com/${MY_ORGANIZATION}/terraform-google-materialize.git
     ```
