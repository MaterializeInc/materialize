1. Update the Materialize Operator version as needed:

   - If you have upgraded your Terraform modules, the Terraform modules may have
   updated its default Helm Chart `operator_version`. If you are satisfied with
   the new Helm Chart version, you can skip this step.

   - If you have not upgraded your Terraform modules, update the
   `operator_version` to the new version.

   The Materialize Operator version is set in the `operator` module's
   [variables.tf](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/terraform-aws-materialize/blob/66fbc3a819c92d5580b5be8292ed1c13675bb3f8/modules/operator/variables.tf#L9)
   file.

1. Initialize the terraform directory.

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

1. Run `terraform plan` with both the `terraform.tfvars` and your
   `mz_instances.tfvars` files and review the changes to be made.

   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars -var-file=mz_instances.tfvars
   ```

   The plan should show the changes to be made for the `materialize_operator`.

1. If you are satisfied with the changes, apply.

   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars -var-file=mz_instances.tfvars
   ```

   To approve the changes and apply, enter `yes`.

   Upon successful completion, you should see output with a summary of changes.

1. Verify that the operator is running:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n materialize get all
   ```

   Verify the operator upgrade by checking its events:

   ```bash
   MZ_OPERATOR=$(kubectl -n materialize get pods --no-headers | grep operator  | awk '{print $1}')
   kubectl -n materialize describe pod/$MZ_OPERATOR
   ```

   - The **Containers** section should show the ``--helm-chart-version``
     argument set to the new version.

   - The **Events** section should list that the new version of the
     orchestratord have been pulled.


1. Back up your ``mz_instances.tfvars`` file.

   ```sh
   cp mz_instances.tfvars original_mz_instances.tfvars
   ```

1. *TBD* Update the version:

   - If you have upgraded your Terraform modules, the Terraform modules may have
   updated its default Helm Chart `operator_version`. If you are satisfied with
   the new Helm Chart version and the associated Materialize instance version,
   you can skip this step.

   - If you have not upgraded your Terraform modules or you wish to override the
   instance version, update.

1. Run `terraform plan` with both the `terraform.tfvars` and your
   `mz_instances.tfvars` files and review the changes to be made.

   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars -var-file=mz_instances.tfvars
   ```

   The plan should show the changes to be made for the Materialize instance.

1. If you are satisfied with the changes, apply.

   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars -var-file=mz_instances.tfvars
   ```

   To approve the changes and apply, enter `yes`.

   Upon successful completion, you should see output with a summary of changes.

1. Verify that the components are running after the upgrade:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n materialize-environment get all
   ```

   Verify upgrade by checking the `balancerd` events:

   ```bash
   MZ_BALANCERD=$(kubectl -n materialize-environment get pods --no-headers | grep balancerd  | awk '{print $1}')
   kubectl -n materialize-environment describe pod/$MZ_BALANCERD
   ```

   The **Events** section should list that the new version of the `balancerd`
   have been pulled.

   Verify the upgrade by checking the `environmentd` events:

   ```bash
   MZ_ENVIRONMENTD=$(kubectl -n materialize-environment get pods --no-headers | grep environmentd  | awk '{print $1}')
   kubectl -n materialize-environment describe pod/$MZ_ENVIRONMENTD
   ```

   The **Events** section should list that the new version of the `environmentd`
   have been pulled.

1. Open the Materialize Console. The Console should display the new version.
