- Make sure you are running SQL Server 2016 or higher with  Change Data Capture
(CDC) support. Materialize uses [Change Data
Capture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server)
which is not readily available on older versions of SQL Server.

- Ensure you have access to your SQL Server instance via the [`sqlcmd` client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-utility),
  or your preferred SQL client.
