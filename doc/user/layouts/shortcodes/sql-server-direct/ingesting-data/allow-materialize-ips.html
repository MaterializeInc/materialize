1. In the [SQL Shell](/console/), or your preferred SQL
   client connected to Materialize, use the [`CREATE SECRET`](/sql/create-secret/)
   command to securely store the password for the SQL Server role you'll use to
   replicate data into Materialize:

    ```mzsql
    CREATE SECRET sqlserver_pass AS '<PASSWORD>';
    ```

1. Use the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/) command to create a
   connection object with access and authentication details for Materialize to
   use:

    ```mzsql
    CREATE CONNECTION sqlserver_connection TO SQL SERVER (
        HOST <host>,
        PORT 1433,
        USER 'materialize',
        PASSWORD SECRET sqlserver_pass,
        DATABASE <database>,
        SSL MODE 'required'
    );
    ```

    - Replace `<host>` with your SQL Server endpoint, and `<database>` with the database you'd like to connect to.
