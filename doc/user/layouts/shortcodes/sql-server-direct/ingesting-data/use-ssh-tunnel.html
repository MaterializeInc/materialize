1. In the [SQL Shell](https://console.materialize.com/), or your preferred SQL
   client connected to Materialize, use the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/#ssh-tunnel)
   command to create an SSH tunnel connection:

    ```mzsql
    CREATE CONNECTION ssh_connection TO SSH TUNNEL (
        HOST '<SSH_BASTION_HOST>',
        PORT <SSH_BASTION_PORT>,
        USER '<SSH_BASTION_USER>'
    );
    ```

    - Replace `<SSH_BASTION_HOST>` and `<SSH_BASTION_PORT`> with the public IP address and port of the SSH bastion host you created [earlier](#b-optional-configure-network-security).

    - Replace `<SSH_BASTION_USER>` with the username for the key pair you created for your SSH bastion host.

1. Get Materialize's public keys for the SSH tunnel connection:

    ```mzsql
    SELECT * FROM mz_ssh_tunnel_connections;
    ```

1. Log in to your SSH bastion host and add Materialize's public keys to the `authorized_keys` file, for example:

    ```sh
    # Command for Linux
    echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAA...76RH materialize" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAA...hLYV materialize" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

1. Back in the SQL client connected to Materialize, validate the SSH tunnel connection you created using the [`VALIDATE CONNECTION`](/sql/validate-connection) command:

    ```mzsql
    VALIDATE CONNECTION ssh_connection;
    ```

    If no validation error is returned, move to the next step.

1. Use the [`CREATE SECRET`](/sql/create-secret/) command to securely store the password for the `materialize` SQL Server user you created [earlier](/sql-server-direct/ingesting-data/enable-cdc):

    ```mzsql
    CREATE SECRET sql_server_pass AS '<PASSWORD>';
    ```

    For AWS IAM authentication, you must create a connection to AWS.  See the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/#aws) command for details.

1. Use the [`CREATE CONNECTION`](/sql/create-connection/) command to create another connection object, this time with database access and authentication details for Materialize to use:

    ```mzsql
    CREATE CONNECTION sql_server_connection TO SQL SERVER (
    HOST '<host>',
    SSH TUNNEL ssh_connection
    );
    ```

    - Replace `<host>` with your SQL Server endpoint.

1. Use the [`CREATE SOURCE`](/sql/create-source/) command to connect Materialize to your SQL Server instance and start ingesting data:

    ```mzsql
    CREATE SOURCE mz_source
      FROM SQL SERVER CONNECTION sql_server_connection
      FOR ALL TABLES;
    ```

    - By default, the source will be created in the active cluster; to use a
      different cluster, use the `IN CLUSTER` clause.

    - To ingest data from specific schemas or tables, use the `FOR SCHEMAS
      (<schema1>,<schema2>)` or `FOR TABLES (<table1>, <table2>)` options
      instead of `FOR ALL TABLES`.

    - To handle unsupported data types, use the `TEXT COLUMNS` or `IGNORE
      COLUMNS` options. Check out the [reference documentation](/sql/create-source/sql-server/#supported-types)
      for guidance.
