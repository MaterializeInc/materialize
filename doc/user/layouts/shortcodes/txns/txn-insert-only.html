An **insert-only** transaction only contains [`INSERT`] statements that insert
into the **same** table.

On a successful [`COMMIT`], all statements from the transaction are committed at
the same timestamp.

```mzsql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (11,current_timestamp,'brownie',10);

-- Subsequent INSERTs must write to sales_items table only
-- Otherwise, the COMMIT will error and roll back the transaction.

INSERT INTO orders VALUES (11,current_timestamp,'chocolate cake',1);
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (11,current_timestamp,'chocolate chip cookie',20);INSERT INTO orders VALUES (11,current_timestamp,'chocolate chip cookie',20);
COMMIT;
```

If, within the transaction, a statement inserts into a table different from that
of the first statement, on [`COMMIT`], the transaction encounters an **internal
ERROR** and rolls back:

```none
ERROR:  internal error, wrong set of locks acquired
```
