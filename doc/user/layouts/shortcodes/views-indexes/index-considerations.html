Before creating an index, consider the following:

- If you create stacked views (i.e., views that depend on each other) to reduce
  code complexity, we recommend that you create an index **only** on the view
  that will serve results. This is enough for query optimization, as long as
  index creation takes into account the expected data access patterns.

- Materialize can reuse indexes across queries that concurrently access the same
  data in memory, which reduces redundancy and resource utilization per query.
  In particular, this means that joins donâ€™t need to store data in memory
  multiple times.

- For queries that have no supporting indexes, Materialize uses the same
  mechanics used by indexes to optimize computations. However, this underlying
  work is discarded after each query run.
