In Materialize, you do not need to always create indexes to help optimize
computations. For queries that have no supporting indexes, Materialize uses the
same mechanics used by indexes to optimize computations.

Specific instances where indexes can be useful to improve performance include:

- When used in ad-hoc queries.

- When used by multiple queries within the same cluster.

- When used to enable delta joins.

For more information, see [Optimization](/transform-data/optimization).
