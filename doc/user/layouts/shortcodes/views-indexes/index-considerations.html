Specific instances where indexes can be useful to improve performance include:

- When used in ad-hoc queries.

- When used by multiple queries within the same cluster.

- When used to enable delta joins.

For more information, see [Optimization](/transform-data/optimization).

**However, before creating an index**, consider the following:

- If you have created various views to act as the building blocks for a view
  from which you will serve the results, creating an index **only** on the
  serving view may be sufficient depending upon your query patterns and usage.

- In Materialize, underlying data structures that are being maintained for an
  index (or a materialized view) can be reused by other views/queries. As such,
  an existing index may be sufficient to support your queries.

- For queries that have no supporting indexes, Materialize uses the same
  mechanics used by indexes to optimize computations. However, this underlying
  work is discarded after each query run.
