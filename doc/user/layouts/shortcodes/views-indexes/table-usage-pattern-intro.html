In Materialize, both [indexes](/concepts/indexes) on views and [materialized
views](/concepts/views/#materialized-views) incrementally update the view
results when Materialize ingests new data. Whereas materialized views persist
the view results in durable storage and can be accessed across clusters, indexes
on views compute and store view results in memory within a **single** cluster.
