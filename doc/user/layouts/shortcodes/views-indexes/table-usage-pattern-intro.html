In Materialize, both [indexes](/concepts/indexes) and [materialized views](/concepts/views/#materialized-views)
store the latest, incrementally updated results as Materialize ingests
new data. Whereas materialized views persist the view results in durable
storage and can be accessed across clusters, indexes store view results in
memory within a **single** cluster.

Maintaining a materialized view in durable storage has resource and latency
costs that should be carefully considered depending on the main usage of the
view, while maintaining an index has [memory costs](/sql/create-index/#memory-footprint).
