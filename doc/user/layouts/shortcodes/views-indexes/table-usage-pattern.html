Some general guidelines for usage patterns include:

| Usage Pattern | General Guideline |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| View results are accessed from a single cluster only                                         | View with an [index](/sql/create-index) |
| View results are accessed across [clusters](/concepts/clusters)                            | Materialized view  |
| Final consumer of the view is a sink or a [`SUBSCRIBE`](/sql/subscribe) operation | Materialized view  |
| View maintenance and query serving are scaled independently | Materialized view  |
