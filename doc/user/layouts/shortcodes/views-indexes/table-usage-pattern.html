In Materialize, both [indexes](/concepts/indexes) on views and [materialized
views](/concepts/views/#materialized-views) incrementally update the view
results when Materialize ingests new data. Whereas materialized views persist
the view results in durable storage and can be accessed across clusters, indexes
on views compute and store view results in memory within a **single** cluster.

Maintaining a materialized view in durable storage has resource and latency
costs that should be carefully considered depending on the main usage of the
view, while maintaining an index has [memory costs](/sql/create-index/#memory-footprint).

Some general guidelines for usage patterns include:

| Usage Pattern | General Guideline |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| View results are accessed from a single cluster only                                         | View with an [index](/sql/create-index) |
| View results are accessed across [clusters](/concepts/clusters)                            | Materialized view  |
| Final consumer of the view is a sink or a [`SUBSCRIBE`](/sql/subscribe) operation | Materialized view  |
| View maintenance and query serving are scaled independently | Materialized view  |
