Materialize supports integration with monitoring tools using HTTP endpoints.

## Quick Monitoring Dashboards

Materialize provides a recommended grafana dashboard and an all-inclusive docker image
preconfigured to run it as [`materialize/simple-monitor`](simplemon-hub).

The only configuration required to get started with the docker image is the
`MATERIALIZED_URL=<host>:<port>` environment variable.

As an example, if you are running `materialized` in a cloud instance at the IP address
172.16.0.0, you could get a dashboard by running this command and opening `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser:

```console
#               expose ports    point it at materialize
$ docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e MATERIALIZED_URL=172.16.0.0:6875 materialize/dashboard
```

While the dashboard is provided as a convenience and should not be relied on for
production monitoring, if you would like to persist metrics across restarts of the
container you can mount a docker volume onto `/prometheus`:

```console
$ docker run -d \
    -v /tmp/prom-data:/prometheus \
    -p 3000:3000 -e MATERIALIZED_URL=172.16.0.0:6875 \
    materialize/dashboard
```

## Health check

Materialize supports a minimal health check endpoint at `<materialized
host>/status`.

## Prometheus

Materialize exposes [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics at the default
path, `<materialized host>/metrics`.

Materialize broadly publishes the following types of data there:

- Materialize-specific data with a `mz_*` prefix. For example,
  `rate(mz_responses_sent_total[10s])` will show you the number of responses
  averaged over 10 second windows.
- Standard process metrics with a `process_*` prefix. For exmple, `process_cpu`.

## Grafana

Materialize provides a [recommended dashboard][dashboard-json] that you can [import into
Grafana][graf-import]. It relies on you having configured prometheus to scrape
materialized.
