1. In Materialize, create a dedicated service account `fdw_svc_account` as an
   **Organization Member**. For details on setting up a service account, see
   [Create a service
   account](https://materialize.com/docs/manage/users-service-accounts/create-service-accounts/)

   {{< tip >}}
   Per the linked instructions, be sure you connect at least once with the new
   service account to finish creating the new account. You will also need the
   connection details (host, port, password) when setting up the foreign server
   and user mappings in PostgreSQL.

1. After you have connected at least once with the new service account to finish
   the new account creation, modify the `fdw_svc_account` role:

   1. Set the default cluster to the name of your serving cluster:

      ```mzsql
      ALTER ROLE fdw_svc_account SET CLUSTER = <serving_cluster>;
      ```

   1. [Grant `USAGE` privileges](/sql/grant-privilege/) on the serving cluster,
      and the database and schema of your views and materialized views.

      ```mzsql
      GRANT USAGE ON CLUSTER <serving_cluster> TO fdw_svc_account;
      GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE <db_name> TO fdw_svc_account;
      GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <db_name.schema_name> TO fdw_svc_account;
      ```

   1. [Grant `SELECT` privileges](/sql/grant-privilege/) to the various
      view(s)/materialized view(s):

      ```mzsql
      GRANT SELECT ON <db_name.schema_name.view_name>, <...> TO fdw_svc_account;
      ```
