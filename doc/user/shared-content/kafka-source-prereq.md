To create a source from Kafka, you must first:

- **Configure network security**
  - Ensure Materialize can connect to your Kafka network.
- **Create a connection to Kafka in Materialize**
  - The connection setup depends on the network security configuration.

For details, see the [Kafka integration
guides](/ingest-data/kafka/#integration-guides) and [Redpanda integration
guides](/ingest-data/redpanda/).
