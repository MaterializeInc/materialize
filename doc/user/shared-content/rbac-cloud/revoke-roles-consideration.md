When you revoke a role from another role (user role/service account
role/independent role), the target role is no longer a member of the revoked
role nor inherits the revoked role's privileges. **However**, privileges are
cumulative: if the target role inherits the same privilege(s) from another role,
the target role still has the privilege(s) through the other role.
