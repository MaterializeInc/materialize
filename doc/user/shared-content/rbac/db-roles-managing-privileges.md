Once a role is created, you can:

- [Manage its current
  privileges](/manage/access-control/manage-roles/#manage-current-privileges-for-a-role)
  (i.e., privileges on existing objects):
  - By granting privileges for a role or revoking privileges from a role.
  - By granting other roles to the role or revoking roles from the role.
    *Recommended for user account/service account roles.*
- [Manage its future
  privileges](/manage/access-control/manage-roles/#manage-future-privileges-for-a-role)
  (i.e., privileges on objects created in the future):
  - By defining default privileges for objects. With default privileges in
   place, a role is automatically granted/revoked privileges as new objects are
   created by **others** (When an object is created, the creator is granted all
   [applicable privileges](/manage/access-control/appendix-privileges/) for that
   object automatically).
