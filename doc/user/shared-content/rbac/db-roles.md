In Materialize, you can create both:
- Individual user or service account roles; i.e., roles associated with a
  specific user or service account.
- Functional roles, not associated with any single user or service
  account, but typically used to define a set of shared
  privileges that can be granted to other user/service/functional roles.

Initially, only the `mz_system` user is available.
