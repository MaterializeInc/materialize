Materialize uses roles to manage access control at two levels:

- [Organization roles](/manage/users-service-accounts/#organization-roles),
  which determines the access to the Console's administrative features and sets
  the **initial database roles** for the user/service account.

- [Database roles](/manage/access-control/#role-based-access-control-rbac), which controls access to database objects and
  operations within Materialize.
