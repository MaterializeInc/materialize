When possible, avoid granting privileges directly to individual user or service
account roles (which are named after email addresses or service account user).
Instead, create reusable, functional roles (e.g., `data_reader`, `view_manager`)
with well-defined privileges, and grant these roles to the individual user or
service account roles. You can also grant functional roles to other functional
roles to compose more complex functional roles.
