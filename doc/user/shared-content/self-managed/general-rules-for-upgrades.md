Whe upgrading:

- **Always** upgrade the operator first and ensure version compatibility between
  the operator and the Materialize instance you are upgrading to.

- **Always** upgrade your Materialize instances after upgrading the operator to
  ensure compatibility.

- **Always check** the [version specific upgrade
  notes](/installation/#version-specific-upgrade-notes).
