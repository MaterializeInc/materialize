Whe upgrading:

- **Always** check the [version specific upgrade
  notes](/self-managed-deployments/upgrading/#version-specific-upgrade-notes).

- **Always** upgrade the operator **first** and ensure version compatibility
  between the operator and the Materialize instance you are upgrading to.

- **Always** upgrade your Materialize instances **after** upgrading the operator
  to ensure compatibility.
