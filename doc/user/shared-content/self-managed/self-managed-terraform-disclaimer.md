These modules are intended for evaluation/demonstration purposes and for serving
as a template when building your own production deployment. As we work towards
enriching and stabilizing these modules, they will be subject to breaking
changes. It is recommended to:

- Fork the repo and pin to a specific version; or

- Use the code as a reference when developing your own deployment.
