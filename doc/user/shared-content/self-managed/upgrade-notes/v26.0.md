- Upgrading to `v26.0.0` is a major version upgrade. To upgrade to `v26.0` from
  `v25.2.X` or `v25.1`, you must first upgrade to `v25.2.16` and then upgrade to
  `v26.0.0`.

- For upgrades, the `inPlaceRollout` setting has been deprecated and will be
  ignored. Instead, use the new setting `rolloutStrategy` to specify either:
  - `WaitUntilReady` (*Default*)
  - `ImmediatelyPromoteCausingDowntime`

  For more information, see
  [`rolloutStrategy`](/installation/#rollout-strategies).

- New requirements were introduced for [license keys](/releases/#license-key).
  To upgrade, you will first need to add a license key to the `backendSecret`
  used in the spec for your Materialize resource.

  See [License key](/releases/#license-key) for details on getting your license
  key.

- Swap is now enabled by default. Swap reduces the memory required to
  operate Materialize and improves cost efficiency. Upgrading to `v26.0`
  requires some preparation to ensure Kubernetes nodes are labeled
  and configured correctly. As such:

  - If you are using the Materialize-provided Terraforms, upgrade to version
    `v0.6.1` of the Terraform.

  - If you are <red>**not**</red> using a Materialize-provided Terraform, refer
    to [Prepare for swap and upgrade to v26.0](/installation/upgrade-to-swap/).
