at a time. For example, upgrades from **v26**.1.0 to **v27**.2.0 is permitted
but **v26**.1.0 to **v28**.0.0 is not. Skipping major versions or downgrading is
not supported. To upgrade from v25.2 to v26.0, you must [upgrade first to v25.2.16+](https://materialize.com/docs/self-managed/v25.2/release-notes/#v25216).
