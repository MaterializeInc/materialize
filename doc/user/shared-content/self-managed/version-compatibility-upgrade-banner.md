When performing major version upgrades, you can upgrade only one major version
at a time. For example, upgrades from **v26**.1.0 to **v27**.2.0 is permitted
but **v26**.1.0 to **v28**.0.0 is not. Skipping major versions or downgrading is
not supported. Furthermore, upgrades from **25.1**.X to **26.X.Y** are not permitted and require upgrading to **25.2.X** first.
