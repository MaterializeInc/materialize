# Evergreen, readable shortlinks.
#
# The materialize.io/s/ namespace is reserved for shortlinks. The idea is that
# even if we change hosting providers, or switch platforms for the marketing
# website, the /s path can always be easily reserved for shortlinks.
#
# This is not a general-purpose URL shortener. Only evergreen content should be
# added here, and only when the layer of indirection is necessary. For example,
# the "bug" shortlink allows us to embed a bug reporting URL in the
# materialized binary that can be updated if we ever switch away from GitHub
# or change how we want bugs to be filed.

# Forward all paths unknown to Netlify to the marketing site.
