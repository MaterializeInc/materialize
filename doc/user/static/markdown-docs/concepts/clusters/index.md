# Clusters

Learn about clusters in Materialize.



## Overview

Clusters are pools of compute resources (CPU, memory, and scratch disk space)
for running your workloads.

The following operations require compute resources in Materialize, and so need
to be associated with a cluster:

- Maintaining [sources](/concepts/sources/) and [sinks](/concepts/sinks/).
- Maintaining [indexes](/concepts/indexes/) and [materialized
  views](/concepts/views/#materialized-views).
- Executing [`SELECT`](/sql/select/) and [`SUBSCRIBE`](/sql/subscribe/)
  statements.


## Resource isolation

Clusters provide **resource isolation.** Each cluster provisions dedicated
compute resources and can fail independently from other clusters.

Workloads on different clusters are strictly isolated from one another. That is,
a given workload has access only to the CPU, memory, and scratch disk of the
cluster that it is running on. All workloads on a given cluster compete for
access to that cluster's compute resources.

## Fault tolerance

The [replication factor](/sql/create-cluster/#replication-factor) of a cluster
determines the number of replicas provisioned for the cluster. Each replica of
the cluster provisions a new pool of compute resources to perform exactly the
same work on exactly the same data.

Provisioning more than one replica for a cluster improves **fault tolerance**.
Clusters with multiple replicas can tolerate failures of the underlying
hardware that cause a replica to become unreachable. As long as one replica of
the cluster remains available, the cluster can continue to maintain dataflows
and serve queries.

> <p>Each replica incurs cost, calculated as <code>cluster size * replication factor</code> per second. See <a href="/administration/billing/" >Usage &amp;

Materialize automatically assigns names to replicas (e.g., `r1`, `r2`). You can
view information about individual replicas in the Materialize console and the
system catalog.

### Availability guarantees

When provisioning replicas,

<ul>
<li>
<p>For clusters sized <strong>up to and including <code>3200cc</code></strong>, Materialize guarantees
that all provisioned replicas in a cluster are distributed across the
underlying cloud provider&rsquo;s availability zones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For clusters sized <strong>above <code>3200cc</code></strong>, even distribution of replicas
across availability zones <strong>cannot</strong> be guaranteed.</p>
</li>
</ul>

## Cluster sizing

When creating a cluster, you must choose its [size](/sql/create-cluster/#size)
(e.g., `25cc`, `50cc`, `100cc`), which determines its resource allocation
(CPU, memory, and scratch disk space) and [cost](/administration/billing/#compute).
The appropriate size for a cluster depends on the resource requirements of your
workload. Larger clusters have more compute
resources available and can therefore process data faster and handle larger data
volumes.

As your workload changes, you can [resize a cluster](/sql/alter-cluster/).

## Best practices

The following provides some general guidelines for clusters. See also
[Operational guidelines](/manage/operational-guidelines/).

### Three-tier architecture in production

<p>In production, use a three-tier architecture, if feasible.</p>
<p><img src="/images/3-tier-architecture.svg" alt="Image of the 3-tier architecture: Source cluster(s), Compute/Transform
cluster(s), Serving cluster(s)"  title="3-tier
architecture"></p>
<p>A three-tier architecture consists of:</p>

| Tier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <strong>Source cluster(s)</strong> | <p><strong>A dedicated cluster(s)</strong> for <a href="/concepts/sources/" >sources</a>.</p> <p>In addition, for upsert sources:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Consider separating upsert sources from your other sources. Upsert sources have higher resource requirements (since, for upsert sources, Materialize maintains each key and associated last value for the key as well as to perform deduplication). As such, if possible, use a separate source cluster for upsert sources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider using a larger cluster size during snapshotting for upsert sources. Once the snapshotting operation is complete, you can downsize the cluster to align with the steady-state ingestion.</p> </li> </ul>  |
| <strong>Compute/Transform cluster(s)</strong> | <p><strong>A dedicated cluster(s)</strong> for compute/transformation:</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href="/concepts/views/#materialized-views" >Materialized views</a> to persist, in durable storage, the results that will be served. Results of materialized views are available across all clusters.</p> > **Tip:** If you are using <strong>stacked views</strong> (i.e., views whose definition depends >   on other views) to reduce SQL complexity, generally, only the topmost >   view (i.e., the view whose results will be served) should be a >   materialized view. The underlying views that do not serve results do not >   need to be materialized. >     </li> <li> <p>Indexes, <strong>only as needed</strong>, to make transformation fast (such as possibly <a href="/transform-data/optimization/#optimize-multi-way-joins-with-delta-joins" >indexes on join keys</a>).</p> > **Tip:** From the compute/transformation clusters, do not create indexes on the >   materialized views for the purposes of serving the view results. >   Instead, use the [serving cluster(s)](#tier-serving-clusters) when >   creating indexes to serve the results. >  >     </li> </ul>  |
| <strong>Serving cluster(s)</strong> | <a name="tier-serving-clusters"></a> <strong>A dedicated cluster(s)</strong> for serving queries, including <a href="/concepts/indexes/" >indexes</a> on the materialized views. Indexes are local to the cluster in which they are created. |

<p>Benefits of a three-tier architecture include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for <a href="/manage/dbt/blue-green-deployments/" >blue/green
deployments</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Independent scaling of each tier.</p>
</li>
</ul>

#### Alternatives

Alternatively, if a three-tier architecture is not feasible or unnecessary due
to low volume or a non-production setup, a two cluster or a single cluster
architecture may suffice.

See [Appendix: Alternative cluster
architectures](/manage/appendix-alternative-cluster-architectures/) for details.

### Use production clusters for production workloads only

Use production cluster(s) for production workloads only. That is, avoid using
production cluster(s) to run development workloads or non-production tasks.

### Consider hydration requirements

During hydration, materialized views require memory proportional to both the
input and output. When estimating required resources, consider both the
hydration cost and the steady-state cost.
