# Views

Learn about views in Materialize.



## Overview

Views represent queries that are saved under a name for reference. Views provide
a shorthand for the underlying query.

Type                   |
-----------------------|-------------------
[ **Views** ]( #views ) | Results are recomputed from scratch each time the view is accessed. You can create an **[index](/concepts/indexes/)** on a view to keep its results **incrementally updated** and available **in memory** within a cluster. |
[**Materialized views**](#materialized-views) | Results are persisted in **durable storage** and **incrementally updated**. You can create an [**index**](/concepts/indexes/) on a materialized view to make the results available in memory within a cluster.

## Views

A view saves a query under a name to provide a shorthand for referencing the
query. Views are not associated with a [cluster](/concepts/clusters/) and can
be referenced across clusters.

During view creation, the underlying query is not executed. Each time the view
is accessed, view results are recomputed from scratch.

```mzsql
CREATE VIEW my_view_name AS
  SELECT ... FROM ...  ;
```

**However**, in Materialize, you can create an [index](/concepts/indexes/) on a
view to keep view results **incrementally updated** in memory within a cluster.
That is, with **indexed views**, you do not recompute the view results each time
you access the view in the cluster; queries can access the already up-to-date
view results in memory.

```mzsql
CREATE INDEX idx_on_my_view ON my_view_name(...) ;
```

See [Indexes and views](#indexes-on-views) for more information.

### Indexes on views

In Materialize, views can be [indexed](/concepts/indexes/). Indexes represent
query results stored in memory. Creating an index on a view executes the
underlying view query and stores the view results in memory within that
[cluster](/concepts/clusters/).

For example, to create an index in the current cluster:

```mzsql
CREATE INDEX idx_on_my_view ON my_view_name(...) ;
```

You can also explicitly specify the cluster:

```mzsql
CREATE INDEX idx_on_my_view IN CLUSTER active_cluster ON my_view (...);
```

**As new data arrives**, the index **incrementally updates** view results in
memory within that [cluster](/concepts/clusters/). Within the cluster, the
**in-memory up-to-date** results are immediately available and computationally
free to query.

## Materialized views

In Materialize, a materialized view is a view whose underlying query is executed
during the view creation. The view results are persisted in durable storage,
**and, as new data arrives, incrementally updated**. Materialized views can be
referenced across [clusters](/concepts/clusters/).

To create materialized views, use the [`CREATE MATERIALIZED
VIEW`](/sql/create-materialized-view) command:

```mzsql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_mat_view_name AS
  SELECT ... FROM ...  ;
```

See also:

- [`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`](/sql/create-materialized-view) for complete
  syntax information

### Hydration and materialized views

Materialized view undergoes hydration when it is created or when its cluster is
restarted. Hydration refers to the reconstruction of in-memory state by reading
data from Materialize’s storage layer; hydration does not require reading data
from the upstream system.

During hydration, materialized views require memory proportional to both
the input and output.

### Indexes on materialized views

In Materialize, materialized views can be queried from any cluster. In addition,
in Materialize, materialized views can be indexed to make the results available
in memory within the cluster associated with the index. For example, in a 3-tier
architecture where you have a separate source cluster(s), a separate
compute/transform cluster(s) with materialized views, and a separate serving
cluster(s), you can create **in the serving cluster** an index on the
materialized views.

```mzsql
CREATE INDEX idx_on_my_view ON my_mat_view_name(...) ;
```

Because materialized views already maintain the up-to-date results in durable
storage, indexes on materialized views can serve up-to-date results without
having to perform additional computation.

> **Note:** Querying a materialized view, whether indexed or not, from any cluster is
> computationally free. However, querying an indexed materialized view within the
> cluster associated with the index is faster since the results are served from
> memory rather than from storage.

## Indexed views vs. materialized views

In Materialize, both <a href="/concepts/indexes" >indexes</a> on views and <a href="/concepts/views/#materialized-views" >materialized
views</a> incrementally update the view
results when Materialize ingests new data. Whereas materialized views persist
the view results in durable storage and can be accessed across clusters, indexes
on views compute and store view results in memory within a <strong>single</strong> cluster.

<p>Some general guidelines for usage patterns include:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Usage Pattern</th>
<th>General Guideline</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>View results are accessed from a single cluster only;<br>such as in a 1-cluster or a 2-cluster architecture.</td>
<td>View with an <a href="/sql/create-index" >index</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>View used as a building block for stacked views; i.e., views not used to serve results.</td>
<td>View</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>View results are accessed across <a href="/concepts/clusters" >clusters</a>;<br>such as in a 3-cluster architecture.</td>
<td>Materialized view (in the transform cluster)<br>Index on the materialized view (in the serving cluster)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Use with a <a href="/serve-results/sink/" >sink</a> or a <a href="/sql/subscribe" ><code>SUBSCRIBE</code></a> operation</td>
<td>Materialized view</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Use with <a href="/transform-data/patterns/temporal-filters/" >temporal filters</a></td>
<td>Materialized view</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>For example:</p>

**3-tier architecture:**

![Image of the 3-tier-architecture
architecture](/images/3-tier-architecture.svg)

In a [3-tier
architecture](/manage/operational-guidelines/#three-tier-architecture)
where queries are served from a cluster different from the compute/transform
cluster that maintains the view results:

- Use materialized view(s) in the compute/transform cluster for the query
  results that will be served.

  If you are using <strong>stacked views</strong> (i.e., views whose definition depends
  on other views) to reduce SQL complexity, generally, only the topmost
  view (i.e., the view whose results will be served) should be a
  materialized view. The underlying views that do not serve results do not
  need to be materialized.

- Index the materialized view in the serving cluster(s) to serve the results
from memory.



**2-tier architecture:**

![Image of the 2-tier-architecture](/images/2-tier-architecture.svg)

In a [2-tier
architecture](/manage/appendix-alternative-cluster-architectures/#two-tier-architecture)
where queries are served from the same cluster that performs the
compute/transform operations:

- Use view(s) in the shared cluster.

- Index the view(s) to incrementally update the view results and serve the
results from memory.

> **Tip:** Except for when used with a [sink](/serve-results/sink/),
> [subscribe](/sql/subscribe/), or [temporal
> filters](/transform-data/patterns/temporal-filters/), avoid creating
> materialized views on a shared cluster used for both compute/transformat
> operations and serving queries. Use indexed views instead.
>




**1-tier architecture:**

![Image of the 1-tier-architecture](/images/1-tier-architecture.svg)

In a [1-tier
architecture](/manage/appendix-alternative-cluster-architectures/#one-tier-architecture)
where queries are served from the same cluster that performs the
compute/transform operations:

- Use view(s) in the shared cluster.

- Index the view(s) to incrementally update the view results and serve the
results from memory.

> **Tip:** Except for when used with a [sink](/serve-results/sink/),

> filters](/transform-data/patterns/temporal-filters/), avoid creating
> materialized views on a shared cluster used for both compute/transformat

## General information

- Views can be referenced across [clusters](/concepts/clusters/).

- Materialized views can be referenced across [clusters](/concepts/clusters/).

- [Indexes](/concepts/indexes) are local to a cluster.

- Views can be monotonic; that is, views can be recognized as append-only.

- Materialized views are not monotonic; that is, materialized views cannot be
  recognized as append-only.
