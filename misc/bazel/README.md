# Bazel

[Official Site](https://bazel.build/)

An open source distributed build system maintained by Google, a fork of their internal build system
known as Blaze.

Bazel's main component for building code are "rules", which are provided by open source rule sets, e.g.
[`rules_rust`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust). When using a rule, e.g.
[`rust_library`](https://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_rust/defs.html#rust_library), you define all of
the inputs (e.g. source files) and extra parameters (e.g. compiler flags) required to build your
target. Bazel then computes a build graph which is used to order operations and determine when
something needs to get re-built.

A common annoyance with Bazel is that it operates in a sandbox. A build that otherwise succeeds on
your machine might fail when run with Bazel because it has a different version of a compiler, or
can't find some necessary file. This is a key feature though because it makes builds hermetic and
allows Bazel to aggressively cache artifacts, which reduces build times.

# Installing `bazelisk`

To use `bazel` you first need to install [`bazelisk`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk), which
is a launcher that automatically makes sure you have the correct version of Bazel installed.

> Note: We have a `.bazelversion` file in our repository that ensures everyone is using the same version.

On macOS you can do this with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install bazelisk
```

For Linux distributions you'll need to grab a binary from their [releases](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases)
page.

# `WORKSPACE`, `BUILD.bazel`, `*.bzl` files

There are three kinds of files in our Bazel setup:

* `WORKSPACE`: Defines the root of our workspace, we only have one of these. This is where we load
  all of our rule sets, download remote repositories, and register toolchains.
* `BUILD.bazel`: Defines how a library/crate is built, where you use "rules". This is generally
  equivalent to a `Cargo.toml`, one per-crate.
* `*.bzl`: Used to define new functions or macros that can be used in `BUILD.bazel` files, written
  in [Starlark](https://bazel.build/rules/language). As a general developer you should rarely if
  ever need to interact with these files.

## Generating `BUILD.bazel` files.

> **tl;dr** run `bin/bazel gen` from the root of the repository.

Just like `Cargo.toml`, associated with every crate is a `BUILD.bazel` file that provides targets that
Bazel can build. We auto-generate these files with a [`cargo-gazelle`](../bazel/cargo-gazelle/) which
developers can easily run via `bin/bazel gen`.

There are times though when `Cargo.toml` doesn't provide all of the information required to build a
crate, for example the [`std::include_str!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_str.html)
macro adds an implicit dependency on the file being included. Bazel operates in a sandbox and thus
will fail unless you tell it about the file! For these cases you can add the dependency via a
`[package.metadata.cargo-gazelle.<target>]` section in the `Cargo.toml`. For example:

```toml
[package.metadata.cargo-gazelle.lib]
compile_data = ["path/to/my/file.txt"]
```

This will add `"path/to/my/file.txt"` to the `compile_data` attribute on the
resulting [`rust_library`](http://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_rust/defs.html#rust_library) Bazel target.

### Supported Configurations

additive_content = "String"

# Bazel test size.
#
# See <https://bazel.build/reference/be/common-definitions#common-attributes-tests>.
size = "String"
# Environment variables to set for test execution.
[[package.metadata.cargo-gazelle.test.<name>.env]]
var1 = "my_value"


# Configuration for binary targets of the crate.
[package.metadata.cargo-gazelle.binary.<name>]
# Skip generating the library target.
skip = [True | False]
# Extra data that will be provided to the Bazel target at compile time.
compile_data = ["String"]
# Extra data that will be provided to the Bazel target at compile and run time.
data = ["String"]
# Extra flags for rustc.
rustc_flags = ["String"]
# Environment variables to set for rustc.
[[package.metadata.cargo-gazelle.binary.<name>.rustc_env]]
var1 = "my_value"

# Environment variables to set for test execution.
[[package.metadata.cargo-gazelle.binary.<name>.env]]
var1 = "my_value"
```

If all else fails, the code that handles this configuration lives in [`misc/bazel/cargo-gazelle`](../bazel/cargo-gazelle/src/config.rs)!


# Platforms

[Official Documentation](https://bazel.build/extending/platforms)

Bazel is designed to be run on a variety of hardware, operating systems, and system configurations.
To manage this complexity Bazel has a concept of "constraints" to allow conditional configuration
of rules, and "platforms" to manage hardware differences. There are three roles that a platform can
serve:

1. Host: the platform that Bazel is invoked from, generally a developers local machine.
2. Execution: the platform that Bazel is using to execute actions or compile code. For Materialize
   this is always the same as the "Host platform" since we don't utilize distributed builds.
3. Target: the platform we are building for.

The platforms that we build for are defined in [/platforms/BUILD.bazel](../bazel/platforms/BUILD.bazel).

A common way to configure a build based on platform is to use the
[`select`](https://bazel.build/reference/be/functions#select) function. This allows you to return
different values depending on the platform we're targetting.

# Toolchains

[Official Documentation](https://bazel.build/extending/toolchains)

Bazel has a specific framework to manage compiler toolchains. For example, instead of having to
specify a Rust toolchain every time you use the `rust_library` rule, you instead register a global
Rust toolchain that rules resolve during analysis.

Toolchains are defined and registered in the [`WORKSPACE`](/WORKSPACE) file.

# [`rules_rust`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust)

For building Rust code we use `rules_rust`. It's primary component is the
[`crates_repository`](http://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_rust/crate_universe.html#crates_repository) rule.

## `crates_repository`

Normally when building a Rust library you define external dependencies in a `Cargo.toml`, and
`cargo` handles fetching the relevant crates, generally from `crates.io`. The [`crates_repository`]
rule does the same thing, we define a set of manifests (`Cargo.toml` files), it will analyze them
and create a Bazel [repository](https://bazel.build/external/overview#repository) containing all of
the necessary external dependencies.

Then to build our crates, e.g. [`mz-adapter`](/src/adapter/), we use the handy
[`all_crate_deps`](http://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_rust/crate_universe.html#all_crate_deps)
macro. When using this macro in a `BUILD.bazel` file, it determines which package we're in (e.g.
`mz-adapter`) and expands to all of the necessary external dependencies. Unfortunately it does not
include dependencies from within our own workspace, so we still need to do a bit of manual work
of specifying dependencies when writing our `BUILD.bazel` files.

In the [`WORKSPACE`](/WORKSPACE) file we define a "root" `crates_repository` named `crates_io`.
