# c_deps/rust-sys

The BUILD files in this directory are for C dependencies that we have a fork of
via a `*-sys` crate, e.g. `rocksdb`. Given we can make changes to the C source
code via our fork, we cannot depend on the upstream versions of these libraries
like we normally do. To build these special case C libraries we concatenate
"additive" `BUILD` files to the ones generated by
`rules_rust/crate_repository`.
