# Maintainer instructions

## Running tests locally

1. Enter the `misc/dbt-materialize` directory:

   ```shell
   cd misc/dbt-materialize
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```shell
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```shell
   . venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install `dbt-materialize` into the virtual environment:

   ```shell
   pip install .
   ```

5. Launch `materialized` in a different terminal:

   ```
   brew install materialize/materialize/materialized
   materialized
   ```

6. Run tests:

   ```
   pytest
   ```

7. Remember to re-install (`pip install .`) if you change the dbt-materialize
   Python code.

## Tips and tricks

All-in-one command to run after making a change to dbt-materialize:

```shell
pip install . && pytest
```

If you want to test dbt-materialize against the latest changes to
`materialized`, build `materialized` from source:

```shell
bin/materialized
```

Run only the tests matching a filter:

```shell
pytest -k TEST-FILTER
```

List all available tests:

```shell
pytest --collect-only
```

Run tests without hiding dbt's output:

```shell
pytest -s
```

Don't drop the schema in `materialized` after a test failure, so that you can
inspect the objects that the test created via `psql`:

```shell
pytest --no-drop-schema
psql -h localhost -p 6875 -U materialize materialize
```

Run dbt-materialize test suite via [mzcompose](../../doc/developer/mzbuild.md#mzcompose)
to match how it is run in CI:

```shell
./mzcompose --dev run default
```
