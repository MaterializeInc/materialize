## dbt-materialize

```

### Configuring your profile

[Materialize](http://materialize.io) is based on the Postgres database protocols, so use the
[dbt postgres settings](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/profile-postgres) in your connection profile,
only substitute `type: materialize` for `type: postgres`.

## Supported Features

### Materializations

Type | Supported? | Details
-----|------------|----------------
view | :white_check_mark: | Creates a [view](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-view/#main).
materializedview | :white_check_mark: | Creates a [materialized view](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-materialized-view/#main).
table | :white_check_mark: | Creates a [materialized view](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-materialized-view/#main). (Actual table support pending [#5266](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/5266))
ephemeral | :white_check_mark: | Executes queries using CTEs.
incremental | :x: | Use the `materializedview` materialization instead!

dbt's incremental models are valuable because they only spend your time and money transforming your new
data as it arrives. Luckily, this is exactly what Materialize's materialized views were built to do! Better yet,
our materialized views will always return up-to-date results without manual or configured refreshes.
For more information, check out [our documentation](https://materialize.com/docs/).

### Seeds

[`dbt seed`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/seed/) will create a static materialized
view from a csv file. You will not be able to add to or update this view after it has been created.
