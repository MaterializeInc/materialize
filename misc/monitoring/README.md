Monitoring tooling for `materialized`
=====================================

This directory contains all the tools that we build to enable the techniques provided by
our [monitoring documentation][docs].

The primary tool right now is the [simple-monitor Docker image](./simple-monitor/), and
the associated grafana and promethes configs, which can serve as an example to users.
