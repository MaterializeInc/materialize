"""Package `materialize` is the top-level Python package for Materialize, Inc.

While the primary product, [materialized], is written in Rust, various demos and
build tools are written in Python. This package enables the sharing of code
between those scripts.

Consider writing additional Python code when:

  * You are writing scripts intended to be run by users of Materialize, not
    developers, e.g. automation for a complicated demo. We can reasonably ask
    users to install Python 3.6+. A Rust toolchain is a much bigger ask.

  * You are about to write a large Bash script.

  * You've already written a Bash script whose complexity and maintainability
    has deteriorated as the script's responsibilities have grown.
