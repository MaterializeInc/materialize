# Buildkite Artifact Search

This tool allows searching Buildkite artifacts (log and text files, including zst-compressed ones) of a build.
zst-compressed files are included by default.

## Usage
```
usage: buildkite-artifact-search [-h]
                                 [--fetch {auto,always,never}]
                                 [--include-zst-files | --no-include-zst-files]
                                 [--max-results MAX_RESULTS]
                                 [--use-regex]
                                 {cleanup,coverage,deploy,deploy-mz-lsp-server,deploy-mz,deploy-website,license,nightly,release-qualification,security,slt,test,www}
                                 buildnumber
                                 jobid
                                 pattern
```
