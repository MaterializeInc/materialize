"""Regenerate lint annotations on all root Rust files.

Rust and Clippy do not permit configuring the allowed/denied lints per
workspace. See [0] for a longstanding feature request. Instead they must be
configured per target--i.e., individually configured via attributes in every
binary, example, test, and library crate.

This script automatically installs the list of lints we want to allow/deny into
each such target. This adds a lot of noise to each crate, but we think the noise
is worth it, as all Rust tools know how to interpret these lint attributes.

We previously used a shell script, named `bin/check`, to instead invoke `cargo
clippy --all-targets` with our desired lint configuration. This avoided the
noise, but did not integrate well with editors, which would be unaware of our
lint configuration. Clippy-enabled editors would flag lints that were disabled
in CI, and elide lints that were required in CI.

`include!` does not help here, as `include!` does not support including files
with inner attributes [1].
