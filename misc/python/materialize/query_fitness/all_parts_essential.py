Test that all parts of the query are important. This is done by
commenting out parts of the query -- if any part of the query
can be commented out without this affecting the result of the query
this means that the query contains constructs and predicates that
do not contribute to the final result in any way.

On the other hand, if all parts of the query are deemed essential,
the query is such that if any part of it is lost during optimization
or execution, the entire query will start producing a different result.
Such queries are suitable for inclusion in regression tests
