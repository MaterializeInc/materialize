A REPL for the Materialize Streaming View Engine
------------------------------------------------

Quick Start
-----------

* You should use `pipx`_ to install scripts, which can installed like::

    python3 -m pip install --user pipx
    python3 -m pipx ensurepath
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

* The postgres dev headers have to be installed for a dependency to install::

    brew install postgres

* We have to download the mzcli package by visiting a url because the repo is currently private: https://github.com/MaterializeInc/mzcli/archive/mtrlz.zip
* Which allows us to install while linking to the brew-provided openssl (by default that should save to ``~/Downloads/mzcli-mtrlz``)::

    LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include" \
        pipx install --spec ~/Downloads/mzcli-mtrlz mzcli

If the above command fails with an error that mzcli-mtrlz cannot be found, then you are probably not using Safari (which
optimistically opens zip files). Try the same command with `~/Downloads/mzcli-mtrlz.zip`` instead of the zip-less file
name.

This is a (wip) materialize client that does auto-completion and syntax highlighting.

Usage
-----

::

    $ pgcli [database_name]

    or

    $ pgcli postgresql://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname][?extra=value[&other=other-value]]

Examples:

::

    $ pgcli local_database

    $ pgcli postgres://amjith:pa$$w0rd@example.com:5432/app_db?sslmode=verify-ca&sslrootcert=/myrootcert

Features
--------

The `pgcli` is written using prompt_toolkit_.

* Auto-completes as you type for SQL keywords as well as tables and
  columns in the database.
* Syntax highlighting using Pygments.
* Smart-completion (enabled by default) will suggest context-sensitive
  completion.

    - ``SELECT * FROM <tab>`` will only show table names.
    - ``SELECT * FROM users WHERE <tab>`` will only show column names.

* Primitive support for ``psql`` back-slash commands.
* Pretty prints tabular data.

Config
------
A config file is automatically created at ``~/.config/pgcli/config`` at first launch.
See the file itself for a description of all available options.

If you're interested in contributing to this project, first of all I would like
to extend my heartfelt gratitude. I've written a small doc to describe how to
get this running in a development setup.

Detailed Installation Instructions:
-----------------------------------

macOS:
======

The easiest way to install pgcli is using Homebrew.

::

    $ brew install pgcli

Done!

Alternatively, you can install ``pgcli`` as a python package using a package
manager called called ``pip``. You will need postgres installed on your system
for this to work.

In depth getting started guide for ``pip`` - https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html.

::

    $ which pip

If it is installed then you can do:

::

    $ pip install pgcli

If that fails due to permission issues, you might need to run the command with
sudo permissions.

::

    $ sudo pip install pgcli

If pip is not installed check if easy_install is available on the system.

::

    $ which easy_install

    $ sudo easy_install pgcli

Linux:
======

In depth getting started guide for ``pip`` - https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html.

Check if pip is already available in your system.

::

    $ which pip

If it doesn't exist, use your linux package manager to install `pip`. This
might look something like:

::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip   # Debian, Ubuntu, Mint etc

    or

    $ sudo yum install python-pip  # RHEL, Centos, Fedora etc

``pgcli`` requires python-dev, libpq-dev and libevent-dev packages. You can
install these via your operating system package manager.


::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev libpq-dev libevent-dev

    or

    $ sudo yum install python-devel postgresql-devel

Then you can install pgcli:

::

    $ sudo pip install pgcli


Docker
======

Pgcli can be run from within Docker. This can be useful to try pgcli without
installing it, or any dependencies, system-wide.

To build the image:

::

    $ docker build -t pgcli .

To create a container from the image:

::

    $ docker run --rm -ti pgcli pgcli <ARGS>

To access postgresql databases listening on localhost, make sure to run the
docker in "host net mode". E.g. to access a database called "foo" on the
postgresql server running on localhost:5432 (the standard port):

::

    $ docker run --rm -ti --net host pgcli pgcli -h localhost foo

To connect to a locally running instance over a unix socket, bind the socket to
the docker container:

::

    $ docker run --rm -ti -v /var/run/postgres:/var/run/postgres pgcli pgcli foo


IPython
=======

Pgcli can be run from within `IPython <https://ipython.org>`_ console. When working on a query,
it may be useful to drop into a pgcli session without leaving the IPython console, iterate on a
query, then quit pgcli to find the query results in your IPython workspace.

Assuming you have IPython installed:

::

    $ pip install ipython-sql

After that, run ipython and load the ``pgcli.magic`` extension:

::

    $ ipython

    In [1]: %load_ext pgcli.magic


Connect to a database and construct a query:

::

    In [2]: %pgcli postgres://someone@localhost:5432/world
    Connected: someone@world
    someone@localhost:world> select * from city c where countrycode = 'USA' and population > 1000000;
    +------+--------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+
    | id   | name         | countrycode   | district     | population   |
    |------+--------------+---------------+--------------+--------------|
    | 3793 | New York     | USA           | New York     | 8008278      |
    | 3794 | Los Angeles  | USA           | California   | 3694820      |
    | 3795 | Chicago      | USA           | Illinois     | 2896016      |
    | 3796 | Houston      | USA           | Texas        | 1953631      |
    | 3797 | Philadelphia | USA           | Pennsylvania | 1517550      |
    | 3798 | Phoenix      | USA           | Arizona      | 1321045      |
    | 3799 | San Diego    | USA           | California   | 1223400      |
    | 3800 | Dallas       | USA           | Texas        | 1188580      |
    | 3801 | San Antonio  | USA           | Texas        | 1144646      |
    +------+--------------+---------------+--------------+--------------+
    SELECT 9
    Time: 0.003s


Exit out of pgcli session with ``Ctrl + D`` and find the query results:

::

    someone@localhost:world>
    Goodbye!
    9 rows affected.
    Out[2]:
    [(3793, u'New York', u'USA', u'New York', 8008278),
     (3794, u'Los Angeles', u'USA', u'California', 3694820),
     (3795, u'Chicago', u'USA', u'Illinois', 2896016),
     (3796, u'Houston', u'USA', u'Texas', 1953631),
     (3797, u'Philadelphia', u'USA', u'Pennsylvania', 1517550),
     (3798, u'Phoenix', u'USA', u'Arizona', 1321045),
     (3799, u'San Diego', u'USA', u'California', 1223400),
     (3800, u'Dallas', u'USA', u'Texas', 1188580),
     (3801, u'San Antonio', u'USA', u'Texas', 1144646)]

The results are available in special local variable ``_``, and can be assigned to a variable of your
choice:

::

    In [3]: my_result = _


Thanks:
-------

A special thanks to `Jonathan Slenders <https://twitter.com/jonathan_s>`_ for
creating `Python Prompt Toolkit <http://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit>`_,
which is quite literally the backbone library, that made this app possible.
Jonathan has also provided valuable feedback and support during the development
of this app.

`Click <http://click.pocoo.org/>`_ is used for command line option parsing
and printing error messages.

Thanks to `psycopg <http://initd.org/psycopg/>`_ for providing a rock solid
interface to Postgres database.

Thanks to all the beta testers and contributors for your time and patience. :)
