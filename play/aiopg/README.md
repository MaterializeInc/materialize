# Example using TAIL with aiopg

This example script shows how to create an asynchronous consumer of a Materialized View using the
aiopg driver. You will need install aiopg either using `pip` or your preferred Python
package manager.

To see the script in action, call the script as so: `./async_tail VIEW_NAME`.
