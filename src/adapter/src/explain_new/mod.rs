//! `EXPLAIN` support for various intermediate representations.
//!
//! Ideally, the `EXPLAIN` support for each IR should be in the
//! crate where this IR is defined. However, due to the use of
//! some generic structs with fields specific to LIR in the current
//! explain paths, and the dependency chain between the crates where
//! the various IRs live, this is not possible. Consequencly, we
//! currently resort to using a wrapper type.
