//! This module contains all of the helpers and code paths for upgrading/migrating the [`Stash`].
//!
//! We facilitate migrations by keeping snapshots of the objects we previously stored, and relying
//! entirely on these snapshots. These exist in the form of `catalog/protos/objects_vXX.proto`. By
//! maintaining and relying on snapshots we don't have to worry about changes elsewhere in the
//! codebase effecting our migrations because our application and serialization logic is decoupled,
//! and the objects of the Stash for a given version are "frozen in time".
//!
//! When you want to make a change to the `Stash` you need to follow these steps:
//!
//! 1. Check the current [`STASH_VERSION`], make sure an `objects_v<STASH_VERSION>.proto` file
//!    exists. If one doesn't, copy and paste the current `objects.proto` file, renaming it to
//!    `objects_v<STASH_VERSION>.proto`.
//! 2. Bump [`STASH_VERSION`] by one.
//! 3. Make your changes to `objects.proto`.
//! 4. Copy and paste `objects.proto`, naming the copy `objects_v<STASH_VERSION>.proto`.
//! 5. We should now have a copy of the protobuf objects as they currently exist, and a copy of
//!    how we want them to exist. For example, if the version of the Stash before we made our
//!    changes was 15, we should now have `objects_v15.proto` and `objects_v16.proto`.
//! 6. Add `v<STASH_VERSION>` to the call to the `objects!` macro in this file.
//! 7. Add a new file to `catalog/src/durable/upgrade`, which is where we'll put the new migration
//!    path.
//! 8. Write an upgrade function using the the two versions of the protos we now have, e.g.
//!    `objects_v15.proto` and `objects_v16.proto`. In this migration code you __should not__
//!    import any defaults or constants from elsewhere in the codebase, because then a future
//!    change could then impact a previous migration.
//! 9. Call your upgrade function in [`crate::durable::upgrade::upgrade()`].
//!
//! When in doubt, reach out to the Surfaces team, and we'll be more than happy to help :)
//!
//! [`Stash`]: mz_stash::Stash

//! TODO(jkosh44) Make this generic over the catalog instead of specific to the stash
//! implementation.
