//! The compute protocol defines the communication between the compute controller and indiviual
//! compute replicas.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The compute protocol consists of [`ComputeCommand`]s and [`ComputeResponse`]s.
//! [`ComputeCommand`]s are sent from the compute controller to the replicas and instruct the
//! receivers to perform some action. [`ComputeResponse`]s are sent in the opposite direction and
//! inform the receiver about status changes of their senders.
//!
//! The compute protocol is an asynchronous protocol. Both participants must expect and be able to
//! gracefully handle messages that don’t reflect the state of the world described by the messages
//! they have previously sent. In other words, messages sent take effect only eventually. For
//! example, after the compute controller has instructed the replica to cancel a peek (by sending a
//! [`CancelPeeks`] command, it must still be ready to accept non-[`Canceled`] responses to the
//! peek. Similarly, if a replica receives a [`CancelPeeks`] command for a peek it has already
//! answered, it must handle that command gracefully (e.g., by ignoring it).
//!
//! While the protocol does not provide any guarantees about the delay between sending a message
//! and it being received and processed, it does guarantee that messages are delivered in the same
//! order they are sent in. For example, if the compute controller sends a [`Peek`] command
//! followed by a [`CancelPeeks`] command, it is guaranteed that [`CancelPeeks`] is only received
//! by the replica after the [`Peek`] command.
//!
//! # Message Transport and Encoding
//!
//! To initiate communication, the replica starts listening on a known host and port, to which the
//! compute controller then connects. We use the gRPC framework for transmitting Protobuf-encoded
//! messages. The replica exposes a single gRPC service (`ProtoCompute`) which contains a single
//! RPC (`CommandResponseStream`). The compute controller invokes this RPC to finalize the
//! connection setup. After the streams have been established, compute commands and responses are
//! transmitted over these streams.
//!
//! # Protocol Stages
//!
//! The compute protocol consists of three stages that must be transitioned in order:
//!
//!   1. Creation
//!   2. Initialization
//!   3. Computation
//!
//! ## Creation Stage
//!
//! The creation stage is the first stage of the compute protocol. It is initiated by the
//! successful establishment of a gRPC connection between compute controller and replica. In this
//! stage, the compute controller must send two creation commands in order:
//!
//!   1. A [`CreateTimely`] command, which instructs the replica to create the timely dataflow
//!      runtime.
//!   2. A [`CreateInstance`] command, which instructs the replica to initialize the rest of its
//!      state.
//!
//! The replica must not send any responses.
//!
//! ## Initialization Stage
//!
//! The initialization stage begins as soon as the compute controller has sent the
//! [`CreateInstance`] command. In this stage, the compute controller informs the replica about its
//! expected dataflow state. It does so by sending any number of [computation
//! commands](#computation-stage), followed by an [`InitializationComplete`] command, which marks
//! the end of the initialization stage.
//!
//! Upon receiving computation commands during the initialization phase, the replica is obligated
//! to ensure its state matches what is requested through the commands. It is up to the replica
//! whether it ensures that by initializing new state or by reusing existing state (through a
//! reconciliation process).
//!
//! The replica may send responses to computation commands it receives. It may also opt to defer
//! sending responses to the computation stage instead.
//!
//! ## Computation Stage
//!
//! The computation stage begins as soon as the compute controller has sent the
//! [`InitializationComplete`] command. In this stage, the compute controller instructs the replica
//! to create and maintain dataflows, and to perform peeks on indexes exported by dataflows.
//!
//! The compute controller may send any number of computation commands:
//!
//!   - [`CreateDataflows`]
//!   - [`AllowCompaction`]
//!   - [`Peek`]
//!   - [`CancelPeeks`]
//!   - [`UpdateConfiguration`]
//!
//! The compute controller must respect dependencies between commands. For example, it must send a
//! [`CreateDataflows`] command before it sends [`AllowCompaction`] or [`Peek`] commands that
//! target the created dataflow.
//!
//! The replica must send the required responses to computation commands. This includes commands it
//! has received in the initialization phase that have not already been responded to.
//!
//! The replica may also send [`FrontierUppers`] and [`SubscribeResponse::DroppedAt`] responses
//! for compute collections that it wasn’t instructed to create through a [`CreateDataflows`]
//! command. This accounts for replicas reporting the dropping of unneeded collections during
//! reconciliation ([#16247]). The compute controller should ignore these responses.
