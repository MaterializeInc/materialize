//! A fork of DD's `JoinCore::join_core`.
//!
//! Currently, compute rendering knows three implementations for linear joins:
//!
//!  * Differential's `JoinCore::join_core`
//!  * A Materialize fork thereof, called `mz_join_core`
//!  * Another Materialize fork thereof, called `mz_join_core_v2`
//!
//! `mz_join_core` exists to solve a responsiveness problem with the DD implementation.
//! DD's join is only able to yield between keys. When computing a large cross-join or a highly
//! skewed join, this can result in loss of interactivity when the join operator refuses to yield
//! control for multiple seconds or longer, which in turn causes degraded user experience.
//!
//! `mz_join_core` resolves the yielding issue but compromises by being quadratic over the number
//! of distinct times in the input. `mz_join_core_v2` is an attempt to replace the quadratic
//! behavior by using a linear scan through times, copied from the DD implementation.
//!
//! For the moment, we keep all three implementations around, selectable through feature flags.
//! Eventually, we hope that `mz_join_core_v2` proves itself sufficiently to become the only join
//! implementation.
