//! A representative of STORAGE and COMPUTE that maintains summaries of the involved objects.
//!
//! The `Controller` provides the ability to create and manipulate storage and compute instances.
//! Each of Storage and Compute provide their own controllers, accessed through the `storage()`
//! and `compute(instance_id)` methods. It is an error to access a compute instance before it has
//! been created; a single storage instance is always available.
//!
//! The controller also provides a `recv()` method that returns responses from the storage and
//! compute layers, which may remain of value to the interested user. With time, these responses
//! may be thinned down in an effort to make the controller more self contained.
//!
//! Consult the `StorageController` and `ComputeController` documentation for more information
//! about each of these interfaces.
