//! Reduction execution planning and dataflow construction.

//! We build `ReducePlan`s to manage the complexity of planning the generated dataflow for a
//! given reduce expression. The intent here is that each creating a `ReducePlan` should capture
//! all of the decision making about what kind of dataflow do we need to render and what each
//! operator needs to do, and then actually rendering the plan can be a relatively simple application
//! of (as much as possible) straight line code.
//!
//! Materialize needs to be able to maintain reductions incrementally (roughly, using
//! time proportional to the number of changes in the input) and ideally, with a
//! memory footprint proportional to the number of reductions being computed. We have to employ
//! several tricks to achieve that, and these tricks constitute most of the complexity involved
//! with planning and rendering reduce expressions. There's some additional complexity involved
//! in handling aggregations with `DISTINCT` correctly so that we can efficiently suppress
//! duplicate updates.
//!
//! In order to optimize the performance of our rendered dataflow, we divide all aggregations
//! into three distinct types. Each type gets rendered separately, with its own specialized plan
//! and dataflow. The three types are as follows:
//!
//! 1. Accumulable:
//!    Accumulable reductions can be computed inline in a Differential update's `difference`
//!    field because they basically boil down to tracking counts of things. `sum()` is an
//!    example of an accumulable reduction, and when some element `x` is removed from the set
//!    of elements being summed, we can introduce `-x` to incrementally maintain the sum. More
//!    formally, accumulable reductions correspond to instances of commutative Abelian groups.
//! 2. Hierarchical:
//!    Hierarchical reductions don't have a meaningful negation like accumulable reductions do, but
//!    they are still commutative and associative, which lets us compute the reduction over subsets
//!    of the input, and then compute the reduction again on those results. For example:
//!    `min[2, 5, 1, 10]` is the same as `min[ min[2, 5], min[1, 10]]`. When we compute hierarchical
//!    reductions this way, we can maintain the computation in sublinear time with respect to
//!    the overall input. `min` and `max` are two examples of hierarchical reductions. More formally,
//!    hierarchical reductions correspond to instances of semigroups, in that they are associative,
//!    but in order to benefit from being computed hierarchically, they need to have some reduction
//!    in data size as well. A function like "concat-everything-to-a-string" wouldn't benefit from
//!    hierarchical evaluation.
//!
//!    When the input is append-only, or monotonic, reductions that would otherwise have to be computed
//!    hierarchically can instead be computed in-place, because we only need to keep the value that's
//!    better than the "best" (minimal or maximal for min and max) seen so far.
//! 3. Basic:
//!    Basic reductions are a bit like the Hufflepuffs of this trifecta. They are neither accumulable nor
//!    hierarchical (most likely they are associative but don't involve any data reduction) and so for these
//!    we can't do much more than just defer to Differential's reduce operator and eat a large maintenance cost.
//!
//! When we render these reductions we want to limit the number of arrangements we produce. When we build a
//! dataflow for a reduction containing multiple types of reductions, we have no choice but to divide up the
//! requested aggregations by type, render each type separately and then take those results and collate them
//! back in the requested output order. However, if we only need to perform aggregations of a single reduction
//! type, we can specialize and render the dataflow to compute those aggregations in the correct order, and
//! return the output arrangement directly and avoid the extra collation arrangement.

/// Accumulable aggregations will be packed into differential dataflow's "difference" field,

/// that indicate they are accumulable will still need to provide an action that takes their
/// data and introduces it as a difference, and the post-processing when the accumulated value
/// is presented as data.

/// Hierarchical aggregations will be subjected to repeated aggregation on initially small but
/// increasingly large subsets of each key. This has the intended property that no invocation
/// is on a significantly large set of values (and so, no incremental update needs to reform
/// significant input data). Hierarchical aggregates can be rendered more efficiently if the
/// input stream is append-only as then we only need to retain the "currently winning" value.
/// Every hierarchical aggregate needs to supply a corresponding ReductionMonoid implementation.
