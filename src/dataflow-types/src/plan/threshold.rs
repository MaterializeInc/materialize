//! Threshold planning logic.
//!
//! The threshold operator produces only rows with a positive cardinality, for example required to
//! provide SQL except and intersect semantics.
//!
//! We build a plan ([ThresholdPlan]) encapsulating all decisions and requirements on the specific
//! threshold implementation. The idea is to decouple the logic deciding which plan to select from
//! the actual implementation of each variant available.
//!
//! Currently, we provide two variants:
//! * The [BasicThresholdPlan] maintains all its outputs as an arrangement. It is beneficial if the
//!     threshold is the final operation, or a downstream operators expects arranged inputs.
//! * The [RetractionsThresholdPlan] maintains retractions, i.e. rows that are not in the output. It
//!     is beneficial to use this operator if the number of retractions is expected to be small, and
//!     if a potential downstream operator does not expect its input to be arranged.
