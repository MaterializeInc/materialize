//! Rendering of `MirRelationExpr::Join` operators, and supporting types.
//!
//! Join planning proceeds by repeatedly introducing collections that
//! extend the set of available output columns. The expected location
//! of each output column is determined by the order of inputs to the
//! join operator: columns are appended in that order.
//!
//! While planning the join, we also have access to logic in the form
//! of expressions, predicates, and projections that we intended to
//! apply to the output of the join. This logic uses "output column
//! reckoning" where columns are identified by their intended output
//! position.
//!
//! As we consider applying expressions to partial results, we will
//! place the results in column locations *after* the intended output
//! column locations. These output locations in addition to the new
//! distinct identifiers for constructed expressions is "extended
//! output column reckoning", as is what we use when reasoning about
//! work still available to be done on the partial join results.
