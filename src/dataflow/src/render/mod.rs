//! Renders a plan into a timely/differential dataflow computation.
//!
//! ## Error handling
//!
//! Timely and differential have no idioms for computations that can error. The
//! philosophy is, reasonably, to define the semantics of the computation such
//! that errors are unnecessary: e.g., by using wrap-around semantics for
//! integer overflow.
//!
//! Unfortunately, SQL semantics are not nearly so elegant, and require errors
//! in myriad cases. The classic example is a division by zero, but invalid
//! input for casts, overflowing integer operations, and dozens of other
//! functions need the ability to produce errors ar runtime.
//!
//! At the moment, only *scalar* expression evaluation can fail, so only
//! operators that evaluate scalar expressions can fail. At the time of writing,
//! that includes map, filter, reduce, and join operators. Constants are a bit
//! of a special case: they can be either a constant vector of rows *or* a
//! constant, singular error.
//!
//! The approach taken is to build two parallel trees of computation: one for
//! the rows that have been successfully evaluated (the "oks tree"), and one for
//! the errors that have been generated (the "errs tree"). For example:
//!
//! ```text
//!    oks1  errs1       oks2  errs2
//!      |     |           |     |
//!      |     |           |     |
//!   project  |           |     |
//!      |     |           |     |
//!      |     |           |     |
//!     map    |           |     |
//!      |\    |           |     |
//!      | \   |           |     |
//!      |  \  |           |     |
//!      |   \ |           |     |
//!      |    \|           |     |
//!   project  +           +     +
//!      |     |          /     /
//!      |     |         /     /
//!    join ------------+     /
//!      |     |             /
//!      |     | +----------+
//!      |     |/
//!     oks   errs
//! ```
//!
//! The project operation cannot fail, so errors from errs1 are propagated
//! directly. Map operators are fallible and so can inject additional errors
//! into the stream. Join operators combine the errors from each of their
//! inputs.
//!
//! The semantics of the error stream are minimal. From the perspective of SQL,
//! a dataflow is considered to be in an error state if there is at least one
//! element in the final errs collection. The error value returned to the user
//! is selected arbitrarily; SQL only makes provisions to return one error to
//! the user at a time. There are plans to make the err collection accessible to
//! end users, so they can see all errors at once.
//!
//! To make errors transient, simply ensure that the operator can retract any
//! produced errors when corrected data arrives. To make errors permanent, write
//! the operator such that it never retracts the errors it produced. Future work
//! will likely want to introduce some sort of sort order for errors, so that
//! permanent errors are returned to the user ahead of transient errorsâ€”probably
//! by introducing a new error type a la:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # struct EvalError;
//! # struct SourceError;
//! enum DataflowError {
//!     Transient(EvalError),
//!     Permanent(SourceError),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If the error stream is empty, the oks stream must be correct. If the error
//! stream is non-empty, then there are no semantics for the oks stream. This is
//! sufficient to support SQL in its current form, but is likely to be
//! unsatisfactory long term. We suspect that we can continue to imbue the oks
//! stream with semantics if we are very careful in describing what data should
//! and should not be produced upon encountering an error. Roughly speaking, the
//! oks stream could represent the correct result of the computation where all
//! rows that caused an error have been pruned from the stream. There are
//! strange and confusing questions here around foreign keys, though: what if
//! the optimizer proves that a particular key must exist in a collection, but
//! the key gets pruned away because its row participated in a scalar expression
//! evaluation that errored?
//!
//! In the meantime, it is probably wise for operators to keep the oks stream
//! roughly "as correct as possible" even when errors are present in the errs
//! stream. This reduces the amount of recomputation that must be performed
//! if/when the errors are retracted.
