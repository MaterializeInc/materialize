/// Constructs a source named `name` in `scope` whose lifetime is controlled
/// both internally and externally.
///
/// The logic for the source is supplied by `construct`, which must return a
/// `tick` function that satisfies `L`. This function will be called
/// periodically while the source is alive and supplied with a capability to
/// produce data and the output handle into which data should be given. The
/// `tick` function is responsible for periodically downgrading this capability
/// whenever it can see that a timestamp is "closed", according to whatever
/// logic makes sense for the source.
///
/// The `tick` function is also given a secondary output handle and capability
/// that can be used to emit a stream of data that is separate from the main
/// "data" output. This can, for example, be used to emit and persist the timestamp bindings.
///
/// If `tick` realizes it will never produce data again, it should indicate that
/// fact by returning [`SourceStatus::Done`], which will immediately drop the
/// capability and guarantee that `tick` is never called again.
///
/// Otherwise, `tick` should return [`SourceStatus::Alive`]. It is `tick`'s
/// responsibility to inform Timely of its desire to be scheduled again by
/// chatting with a [`timely::scheduling::activate::Activator`]. Returning
/// [`SourceStatus::Alive`] does not alone cause the source to be scheduled
/// again; it merely keeps the capability alive.
///
/// The lifetime of the source is also controlled by the returned
/// [`SourceToken`]. When the last clone of the `SourceToken` is dropped, the
/// `tick` function will no longer be called, and the capability will eventually
/// be dropped.
///
/// When the source token is dropped, the timestamping_flag is set to false
/// to terminate any spawned threads in the source operator
