/// Returns a new ConfigSet containing every `Config`` in Materialize.
///
/// Each time this is called, it returns a new ConfigSet disconnected from any
/// others. It may be cloned and passed around, and updates to any of these
/// copies will be reflected in the clones. Values from a `ConfigSet` may be
/// copied to a disconnected `ConfigSet` via `ConfigUpdates`, which can be
/// passed over the network to do the same across processes.
///
/// TODO(cfg): Consider replacing this with a static global registry powered by
/// something like the `ctor` or `inventory` crate. This would solve the
/// dependency issue of this crate depending on every crate that uses dyncfgs.
/// However, on the other hand, it would involve managing the footgun of a
/// Config being linked into one binary but not the other.
