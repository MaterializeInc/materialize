    // The goal is to build a regex that matches the same strings as the LIKE
    // pattern.
    //
    // LIKE patterns always cover the whole string, so we anchor the regex on
    // both sides. An underscore (`_`) in a LIKE pattern matches any single
    // character and a percent sign (`%`) matches any sequence of zero or more
    // characters, so we translate those operators to their equivalent regex
    // operators, `.` and `.*`, respectively. Other characters match themselves
    // and are copied directly, unless they have special meaning in a regex, in
    // which case they are escaped in the regex with a backslash (`\`).
    //
    // Note that characters in LIKE patterns may also be escaped by preceding
    // them with a backslash. This has no effect on most characters, but it
    // removes the special meaning from the underscore and percent sign
    // operators, and means that matching a literal backslash requires doubling
    // the backslash.
    //
    // TODO(benesch): SQL permits selecting a different escape character than
    // the backslash via LIKE '...' ESCAPE '...'. We will need to support this
    // syntax eventually.
