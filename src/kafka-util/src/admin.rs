/// This function does not return successfully unless it can find the metadata
/// for the newly-created topic in a call to [`rdkafka::client::Client::fetch_metadata`] and
/// verify that the metadata reports the topic has the number of partitions
/// requested in `new_topic`. Empirically, this seems to be the condition that
/// guarantees that future attempts to consume from or produce to the topic will
/// succeed.
