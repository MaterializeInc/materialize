 - The `mz config` command for managing the configuration parameters for the CLI.

### Changed
 - The `mz shell` command has been renamed to `mz sql`. It is no longer required to specify a region: the region is either retrieved from the configuration file (default), or can be passed as a parameter using the `region` flag: `mz sql --region='aws/us-east-1'`
 - The `mz login` command has been renamed to `mz profile`.

### Removed
