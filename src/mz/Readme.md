# Materialize CLI [WIP]

Rust implementation of critical features for usage and deployment of Materialize platform instances.
It provides the following actions:

* Login
* Enable/Delete Regions
* Shell

## Documentation

### Install

Clone the repository. Once inside, run:

```bash
cargo build --package mz --release
```

After a successful build:

```bash
cd ./target/release
```

[Install dependencies](#Dependencies)

### Help

Use command help to understand usage:

```bash
mz help
```

### Login

The CLI lets you login into the platform and automatically create all it needs to work.

Using the browser:

```bash
mz login
```

Using email and password:

```bash
mz login interactive
```

### Profiles

The CLI needs a default profile. To populate it go through the login command `mz login`. If you want to do it manually add the default profile to the config file:

```TOML
["profiles.default"]
email = "your@email.com"
secret = "YOUR_SECRET"
client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
```

Linux: `.config/mz/profiles.toml`
macOS (Monterrey): `.config/mz/profiles.toml`
Windows: (TBC)

### Regions

Deploy Materialize in any region by simply:

```bash
mz regions enable us-east-1
```

Delete any region using:

```bash
mz regions delete us-east-1
```

***Delete command is followed by a prompt warning to avoid any accidental delete***


### Shell

Connect to a Materialize instance to run your SQL using the CLI shell:

```bash
mz shell us-east-1
```

### Dependencies

Install `psql` dependency for the shell:

```bash

# Linux (TBC)
apt-get install postgresql-client

# macOS
brew install libpq

echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

# Windows (TBC)
```


### Future work
#### Improvements
- [ ]  Selecting a default region
- [ ]  Run requests in parallel
- [ ]  Enable selecting an environment as a flag in `Shell`
- [ ]  `region` should be a flag not a subcommand
- [ ]  `Interactive` should be a flag and not a subcommand
- [ ]  Reduce `.unwrap` usage
- [ ]  Add optional `â€”force` command to delete to avoid manual input
- [ ]  Handle request errors to frontegg
- [ ]  Handle port already taken
