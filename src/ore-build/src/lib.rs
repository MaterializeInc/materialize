//! Internal utility libraries used in Build Scripts for Materialize.
//!
//! This exists separately from the `ore` crate because when cross compiling
//! (or building with Bazel) build scripts get built for the host architecture,
//! because that's where they're executed. `ore` has _many_ dependencies yet
//! nearly none of them are used in build scripts, so we end up building a lot
//! of unnecessary crates.
//!
//! Moving the common utilities for build scripts into this crate, considerably
//! improves build times.
