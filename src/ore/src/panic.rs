use std::panic;

/// Instructs the entire process to abort if any thread panics.
///
/// By default, when a thread panics in Rust, only that thread is affected, and
/// other threads continue running unaffected. This is a bad default. In almost
/// all programs, thread panics are unexpected, unrecoverable, and leave the
/// overall program in an invalid state. It is therefore typically less
/// confusing to abort the entire program.
///
/// For example, consider a simple program with two threads communicating
/// through a channel, where the first thread is waiting for the second thread
/// to send a value over the channel. If the second thread panics, the first
/// thread will block forever for a value that will never be produced. Blocking
/// forever will be more confusing to the end user than aborting the program
/// entirely.
///
/// Computations in which a panic is expected can still use
/// [`panic::catch_unwind`] to recover.
