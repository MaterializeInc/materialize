/// Overwrites the default panic handler with an enhanced panic handler.
///
/// The enhanced panic handler:
///
///   * Always emits a backtrace, regardless of how `RUST_BACKTRACE` was
///     configured.
///
///   * Writes to stderr as atomically as possible, to minimize interleaving
///     with concurrent log messages.
///
///   * Instructs the entire process to abort if any thread panics.
///
///     By default, when a thread panics in Rust, only that thread is affected,
///     and other threads continue running unaffected. This is a bad default. In
///     almost all programs, thread panics are unexpected, unrecoverable, and
///     leave the overall program in an invalid state. It is therefore typically
///     less confusing to abort the entire program.
///
///     For example, consider a simple program with two threads communicating
///     through a channel, where the first thread is waiting for the second
///     thread to send a value over the channel. If the second thread panics,
///     the first thread will block forever for a value that will never be
///     produced. Blocking forever will be more confusing to the end user than
///     aborting the program entirely.
///
/// Note that after calling this function, computations in which a panic is
/// expected must use the special [`catch_unwind`] function in this module to
/// recover. Note that the `catch_unwind` function in the standard library is
/// **not** compatible with this improved panic handler.
