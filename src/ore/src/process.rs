/// Halts the process.
///
/// `halt` forwards the provided arguments to the [`tracing::warn`] macro, then
/// terminates the process with exit code 166.
///
/// Halting a process is a middle ground between a graceful shutdown and a
/// panic. Use halts for errors that are severe enough to require shutting down
/// the process, but not severe enough to be considered a crash. Halts are not
/// intended to be reported to error tracking tools (e.g., Sentry).
///
/// There are two common classes of errors that trigger a halt:
///
///   * An error that indicates a new process has taken over (e.g., an error
///     indicating that the process's leader epoch has expired).
///
///   * A retriable error where granular retry logic would be tricky enough to
///     write that it has not yet been worth it. Since restarting from a fresh
///     process must *always* be correct, forcing a restart is an easy way to
///     tap into the existing whole-process retry logic. Use halt judiciously in
///     these cases, as restarting a process can be inefficient (e.g., mandatory
///     restart backoff, rehydrating expensive state).

    // Using `std::process::exit` here would be unsound as that function invokes libc's `exit`
    // function, which is not thread-safe [1]. There are two viable work arounds for this:
    //
    //  * Calling libc's `_exit` function instead, which is thread-safe by virtue of not performing
    //    any cleanup work.
    //  * Introducing a global lock to ensure only a single thread gets to call `exit` at a time.
    //
    // We chose the former approach because it's simpler and has the additional benefit of
    // protecting us from third-party code that installs thread-unsafe exit handlers.
    //
    // Note that we are fine with not running any cleanup code here. This behaves just like an
    // abort we'd do in response to a panic. Any code that relies on cleanup code to run before
    // process termination is already unsound in the face of panics and hardware failure.
