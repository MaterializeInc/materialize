# Persist

Persist is an implementation detail of STORAGE. Its "public" API is used only
by STORAGE and code outside of STORAGE should be talking to STORAGE, not
persist. However, having this strong API boundary between the two allows for the
two teams to execute independently.

Persist's primary abstraction is a "shard", which is a durable and definite
[Time-Varying Collection (TVC)]. Persist requires that the collection's "data"
is key-value structured (a `()` unit value is fine) but otherwise allows the
key, value, time, and diff to be abstract in terms of the [Codec] and [Codec64]
encode/decode traits. As a result, persist is independent of Materialize's
internal data formats: `Row` etc.

[Time-Varying Collection (TVC)]: https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/blob/main/doc/developer/platform/formalism.md#time-varying-collections
[Codec]: mz_persist_types::Codec
[Codec64]: mz_persist_types::Codec64

Along with talking to the outside world, STORAGE pilots persist shards around to
present a "STORAGE collection", which is a durable TVC that handles reshardings
and version upgrades. A persist shard is exactly a [storage shard] and they can be used
interchangeably.

## FAQ: What is persist's throughput?

In general, with proper usage and hardware (and once we finish tuning), persist
should be able to saturate 75% or more of the available network bandwidth on
both writes and reads.

Experimentally, the `s3_pg` configuration has sustained 64 MiB/s of goodput for
10+ hours in an open loop benchmark. This is nowhere near our max, but should
easily be sufficient for M1. TODO: Add numbers under contention.

```sh
cargo run -p mz-persist-client --bin persist_open_loop_benchmark --blob_uri=... --consensus_uri=...
```


## FAQ: What is persist's latency?

Materialize is not an OLTP database, so our initial tunings are for throughput
over latency. There are some tricks we can play in the future to get these
latencies down, but here's a quick idea of where we're starting.

The vertical axis:
- `mem_mem` uses im-memory implementations of "external durability". These exist
  for testing but here they're nice because they show the overhead of persist
  itself.
- `file_pg` uses files for blob and Postgres for consensus. This is what you
  might expect in local development or in CI. (These numbers, like the rest, are
  from a persist-benchmarking ./bin/scratch box. Maybe this one should be from a
  laptop?)
- `s3_pg` uses s3 for blob and AWS Postgres Aurora for consensus. This is what
  you might expect in production.

The horizontal axis:
- `write` is an un-contended small write (append/compare_and_append).
- `wtl` (write_to_listen) is the total latency between the beginning of a
  small write and it being emitted by a listener. Think of this as persist's
  contribution to the latency between `INSERT`-ing a row into Materialize and
  getting it back out with `SELECT`.
- The `(est)` variant is whatever Criterion uses to select its "best estimate"
  and `(p95)` is the higher end of Criterion's confidence interval (not actually
  a p95 but sorta like one).
- TODO: Real p50/p95/p99/max.

| | write (est) | write (p95) | wtl (est) | wtl (p95) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mem_mem | < 1ms | <1ms | 5.1ms | 5.2ms |
| file_pg | 5.5ms | 5.6ms | 6.4ms | 6.5ms |
| s3_pg | 45ms | 47ms | 79ms | 82ms |

These numbers are from our micro-benchmarks. (Note that if you update these
numbers or look at raw benchmark numbers in commit messages, you need to divide
the output by however many batches are used because each repeats the operation
for each batch to shake out issues that don't otherwise surface. The default
number of batches is 8.)

```sh
cargo bench -p mz-persist-client --bench=benches
```

Larger writes are expected to take the above latency floor plus however long it
takes to write the extra data to e.g s3. TODO: Get real numbers for larger
batches.
