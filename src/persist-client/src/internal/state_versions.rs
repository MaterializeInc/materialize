/// A durable, truncatable log of versions of [State].
///
/// As persist metadata changes over time, we make its versions (each identified
/// by a [SeqNo]) durable in two ways:
/// - `rollups`: Periodic copies of the entirety of [State], written to [Blob].
/// - `diffs`: Incremental [StateDiff]s, written to [Consensus].
///
/// The following invariants are maintained at all times:
/// - A shard is initialized iff there is at least one version of it in
///   Consensus.
/// - The first version of state is written to `SeqNo(1)`. Each successive state
///   version is assigned its predecessor's SeqNo +1.
/// - `current`: The latest version of state. By definition, the largest SeqNo
///   present in Consensus.
/// - As state changes over time, we keep a range of consecutive versions
///   available. These are periodically `truncated` to prune old versions that
///   are no longer necessary.
/// - `earliest`: The first version of state that it is possible to reconstruct.
///   - Invariant: `earliest <= current.seqno_since()` (we don't garbage collect
///     versions still being used by some reader).
///   - Invariant: `earliest` is always the smallest Seqno present in Consensus.
///     - This doesn't have to be true, but we select to enforce it.
///     - Because the data stored at that smallest Seqno is an incremental diff,
///       to make this invariant work, there needs to be a rollup at either
///       `earliest-1` or `earliest`. We choose `earliest` because it seems to
///       make the code easier to reason about in practice.
///     - A consequence of the above is when we garbage collect old versions of
///       state, we're only free to truncate ones that are `<` the latest rollup
///       that is `<= current.seqno_since`.
/// - `live diffs`: The set of SeqNos present in Consensus at any given time.
/// - `live states`: The range of state versions that it is possible to
///   reconstruct: `[earliest,current]`.
///   - Because of earliest and current invariants above, the range of `live
///     diffs` and `live states` are the same.
/// - The set of known rollups are tracked in the shard state itself.
///   - For efficiency of common operations, the most recent rollup's Blob key
///     is always denormalized in each StateDiff written to Consensus. (As
///     described above, there is always a rollup at earliest, so we're
///     guaranteed that there is always at least one live rollup.)
///   - Invariant: The rollups in `current` exist in Blob.
///     - A consequence is that, if a rollup in a state you believe is `current`
///       doesn't exist, it's a guarantee that `current` has changed (or it's a
///       bug).
///   - Any rollup at a version `< earliest-1` is useless (we've lost the
///     incremental diffs between it and the live states). GC is tasked with
///     deleting these rollups from Blob before truncating diffs from Consensus.
///     Thus, any rollup at a seqno < earliest can be considered "leaked" and
///     deleted by the leaked blob detector.
///   - Note that this means, while `current`'s rollups exist, it will be common
///     for other live states to reference rollups that no longer exist.

        // earliest, but current doesn't. So, for the migration, if
