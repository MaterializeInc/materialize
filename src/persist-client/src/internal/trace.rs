//! An append-only collection of compactable update batches. The Spine below is
//! a fork of Differential Dataflow's [Spine] with minimal modifications. The
//! original Spine code is designed for incremental (via "fuel"ing) synchronous
//! merge of in-memory batches. Persist doesn't want compaction to block
//! incoming writes and, in fact, may in the future elect to push the work of
//! compaction onto another machine entirely via RPC. As a result, we abuse the
//! Spine code as follows:
//!
//! [Spine]: differential_dataflow::trace::implementations::spine_fueled::Spine
//!
//! - The normal Spine works in terms of [Batch] impls. A `Batch` is added to
//!   the Spine. As progress is made, the Spine will merge two batches together
//!   by: constructing a [Batch::Merger], giving it bits of fuel to
//!   incrementally perform the merge (which spreads out the work, keeping
//!   latencies even), and then once it's done fueling extracting the new single
//!   output `Batch` and discarding the inputs.
//! - Persist instead represents a batch of blob data with a [HollowBatch]
//!   pointer which contains the normal `Batch` metadata plus the keys necessary
//!   to retrieve the updates.
//! - [SpineBatch] wraps `HollowBatch` and has a [FuelingMerge] companion
//!   (analogous to `Batch::Merger`) that allows us to represent a merge as it
//!   is fueling. Normally, this would represent real incremental compaction
//!   progress, but in persist, it's simply a bookkeeping mechanism. Once fully
//!   fueled, the `FuelingMerge` is turned into a fueled [SpineBatch],
//!   which to the Spine is indistinguishable from a merged batch. At this
//!   point, it is eligible for asynchronous compaction and a `FueledMergeReq`
//!   is generated.
//! - At any later point, this request may be answered via
//!   [Trace::apply_merge_res]. This internally replaces the
//!   `SpineBatch`, which has no effect on the structure of `Spine`
//!   but replaces the metadata in persist's state to point at the
//!   new batch.
//! - `SpineBatch` is explictly allowed to accumulate a list of `HollowBatch`s.
//!   This decouples compaction from Spine progress and also allows us to reduce
//!   write amplification by merging `N` batches at once where `N` can be
//!   greater than 2.
//!
//! [Batch]: differential_dataflow::trace::Batch
//! [Batch::Merger]: differential_dataflow::trace::Batch::Merger

/// The `Spine` is a general-purpose trace implementation based on collection

/// batch type, and can be instantiated for any implementor of `trace::Batch`.
///
/// ## Design
///
/// This spine is represented as a list of layers, where each element in the
/// list is either
///
///   1. MergeState::Vacant  empty
///   2. MergeState::Single  a single batch
///   3. MergeState::Double  a pair of batches
///
/// Each "batch" has the option to be `None`, indicating a non-batch that
/// nonetheless acts as a number of updates proportionate to the level at which
/// it exists (for bookkeeping).
///
/// Each of the batches at layer i contains at most 2^i elements. The sequence
/// of batches should have the upper bound of one match the lower bound of the
/// next. Batches may be logically empty, with matching upper and lower bounds,
/// as a bookkeeping mechanism.
///
/// Each batch at layer i is treated as if it contains exactly 2^i elements,
/// even though it may actually contain fewer elements. This allows us to
/// decouple the physical representation from logical amounts of effort invested
/// in each batch. It allows us to begin compaction and to reduce the number of
/// updates, without compromising our ability to continue to move updates along
/// the spine. We are explicitly making the trade-off that while some batches
/// might compact at lower levels, we want to treat them as if they contained
/// their full set of updates for accounting reasons (to apply work to higher
/// levels).
///
/// We maintain the invariant that for any in-progress merge at level k there
/// should be fewer than 2^k records at levels lower than k. That is, even if we
/// were to apply an unbounded amount of effort to those records, we would not
/// have enough records to prompt a merge into the in-progress merge. Ideally,
/// we maintain the extended invariant that for any in-progress merge at level
/// k, the remaining effort required (number of records minus applied effort) is
/// less than the number of records that would need to be added to reach 2^k
/// records in layers below.
///
/// ## Mathematics
///
/// When a merge is initiated, there should be a non-negative *deficit* of
/// updates before the layers below could plausibly produce a new batch for the
/// currently merging layer. We must determine a factor of proportionality, so
/// that newly arrived updates provide at least that amount of "fuel" towards
/// the merging layer, so that the merge completes before lower levels invade.
///
/// ### Deficit:
///
/// A new merge is initiated only in response to the completion of a prior
/// merge, or the introduction of new records from outside. The latter case is
/// special, and will maintain our invariant trivially, so we will focus on the
/// former case.
///
/// When a merge at level k completes, assuming we have maintained our invariant
/// then there should be fewer than 2^k records at lower levels. The newly
/// created merge at level k+1 will require up to 2^k+2 units of work, and
/// should not expect a new batch until strictly more than 2^k records are
/// added. This means that a factor of proportionality of four should be
/// sufficient to ensure that the merge completes before a new merge is
/// initiated.
///
/// When new records get introduced, we will need to roll up any batches at
/// lower levels, which we treat as the introduction of records. Each of these
/// virtual records introduced should either be accounted for the fuel it should
/// contribute, as it results in the promotion of batches closer to in-progress
/// merges.
///
/// ### Fuel sharing
///
/// We like the idea of applying fuel preferentially to merges at *lower*
/// levels, under the idea that they are easier to complete, and we benefit from
/// fewer total merges in progress. This does delay the completion of merges at
/// higher levels, and may not obviously be a total win. If we choose to do
/// this, we should make sure that we correctly account for completed merges at
/// low layers: they should still extract fuel from new updates even though they
/// have completed, at least until they have paid back any "debt" to higher
/// layers by continuing to provide fuel as updates arrive.
