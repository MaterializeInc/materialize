/// All updates at times greater or equal to `until` will be suppressed.
/// The `map_filter_project` argument, if supplied, may be partially applied,

///
/// Users of this function have the ability to apply flow control to the output
/// to limit the in-flight data (measured in bytes) it can emit. The flow control
/// input is a timely stream that communicates the frontier at which the data
/// emitted from by this source have been dropped.
///
/// **Note:** Because this function is reading batches from `persist`, it is working
/// at batch granularity. In practice, the source will be overshooting the target
/// flow control upper by an amount that is related to the size of batches.
///
/// If no flow control is desired an empty stream whose frontier immediately advances
/// to the empty antichain can be used. An easy easy of creating such stream is by
/// using [`timely::dataflow::operators::generic::operator::empty`].
