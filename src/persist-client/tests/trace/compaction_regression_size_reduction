# Regression test for a bug in FuelingMerge. We previously tracked how much
# total fuel a FuelingBatch had received, calling it progress. Whenever it
# received new fuel, we compared progress against self.b1.len() + self.b2.len()
# to see how much work remained. However, because we (quite surprisingly) swap
# out the innards of a batch when applying a compaction response, if the
# compaction resulted in consolication of updates, a batch len could become
# smaller. This could lead to a situation where progress was greater than the
# sum of the two batch lengths. In debug, this would present as a subtraction
# underflow panic. In release, it would actually underflow and result in a batch
# that would not complete given any amount of fuel, which then presented as a
# "Attempted to insert batch into incomplete merge" panic.

# Insert two batches and then a big batch so that 0-1 and 1-2 are fueled to
# merge. This also creates a FuelingMerge(0-2,2-3).
