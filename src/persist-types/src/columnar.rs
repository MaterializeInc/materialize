//! Columnar understanding of persisted data
//!
//! For efficiency/performance, we directly expose the columnar structure of
//! persist's internal encoding to users during encoding and decoding. For
//! ergonomics, we wrap the [`arrow`] crate we use to read and write parquet data.
//!
//! Some of the requirements that led to this design:
//! - Support a separation of data and schema because Row is not
//!   self-describing: e.g. a Datum::Null can be one of many possible column
//!   types. A RelationDesc is necessary to describe a Row schema.
//! - Narrow down [`arrow::datatypes::DataType`] (the arrow "logical" types) to a
//!   set we want to support in persist.
//! - Associate a [`parquet::basic::Encoding`] with each of those types.
//! - Do `dyn Any` downcasting of columns once per part, not once per update.
//! - Unlike [`arrow`], be precise about whether each column is optional or not.
//!
//! The primary presentation of this abstraction is a sealed trait [Data], which
//! is implemented for the owned version of each type of data that can be stored
//! in persist: `int64`, `Option<String>`, etc.
//!
//! Under the hood, it's necessary to store something like a map of `name ->
//! column`. A natural instinct is to make Data object safe, but I couldn't
//! figure out a way to make that work without severe limitations. As a result,
//! the DataType enum is introduced with a 1:1 relationship between variants and
//! implementations of Data. This allows for easy type erasure and guardrails
//! when downcasting the types back.
//!
//! Note: The "Data" strategy is roughly how columnation works and the
//! "DataType" strategy is roughly how [`arrow`] works. Doing both of them gets us
//! the benefits of both, while the downside is code duplication and cognitive
//! overhead.
//!
//! The Data trait has associated types for the exclusive "builder" type for the
//! column and for the shared "reader" type. These also implement some common traits
//! to make relationships between types more structured.
//!
//! Finally, the [Schema] trait maps an implementor of [Codec] to the underlying
//! column structure. It also provides a [PartEncoder] and [PartDecoder] for
//! amortizing any downcasting that does need to happen.
