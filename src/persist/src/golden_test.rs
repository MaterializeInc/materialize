/// A test to catch changes in any part of the end-to-end persist encoding.
///
/// In the short-term, we are persisting only data that can safely be wiped in a
/// pinch (specifically the mz_metrics and mz_metric_histogram system tables).
/// At the very root of the metadata and data stored by persist, and the first
/// thing read on startup, is BlobMeta. It's encoded with a version
/// (BlobMeta::CURRENT_VERSION) and stored in blob storage. Our short-term
/// strategy (~1-2 months) to deal with backward compatibility is to bump this
/// version when any of the encodings used by persist change. If persist starts
/// up and encounters a BlobMeta encoding version less than its current one,
/// it's safe to simply wipe it and start fresh. (If it encounters one that's
/// greater, it should error out, because that could be from a version of
/// materialize where we _are_ persisting un-wipe-able data.)
///
/// For this to work, we need a robust way to catch changes that indicate that a
/// BlobMeta encoding version bump is needed. Code review will catch some of
/// them, and this test will catch more of them. It will have false positives,
/// which is absolutely fine (a manual verification that we don't need to bump
/// the version can be declared by updating the "golden"), but it hopefully will
/// not have any false negatives.
///
/// Reminder that the real answer here is to make persist transparently handle
/// data written by previous versions of persist. It's a solvable problem, we
/// just haven't gotten there yet. Once we do, this test will be modified to be
/// a series of tests that verify we do correctly handle old versions of persist
/// data.
///
/// Test initial setup:
/// - A persistence runtime is started working against mem storage.
/// - A deterministic series of operations are run against the runtime, one at a
///   time, waiting for each to finish before running the next to eliminate
///   concurrency. Given this workload pattern, the behavior of key external
///   elements of the persist API are deterministic (the registered streams and
///   the data in each, along with the seal and since timestamps).
/// - For the above, we already have a model of the traffic that can be run
///   against the persist API as well as a deterministic traffic generator in
///   the nemesis test. These are reused here for convenience.
/// - The persist API is stopped and the full contents of mem storage are
///   gathered (into the Blobs struct below) and serialized (using serde_json).
/// - This state is checked in to source control as the `golden_test.json` file.
///
/// Test runtime:
/// - When the test is run, it loads the state in the `golden_test.json` file
///   into mem storage. A persist runtime is started with that storage but no
///   write traffic is run against it. Instead we read the key deterministic
///   state mentioned above (into the PersistState struct).
/// - This does the bulk of the work. If any of the metadata or data formats
///   have changed in a backward compatible way, this previous step should error
///   somewhere along the way.
/// - For additional measure, we run the "initial setup" steps again, read that
///   state also into a PersistState struct and compare them. This is mostly a
///   sanity check that we don't succeed in reading the old data in an
///   uninteresting way (e.g. if we change the name of the META key), it's
///   unlikely given the current encoding library that some small detail will be
///   different between the two states.
/// - Unfortunately, this is probably the most likely source of false positives.
///   The random traffic generator is deterministic at a given commit, but we do
///   change its logic from time to time (and this will cause the states to not
///   match). The resolution is to simply update the test golden as described
///   below without the BlobMeta::CURRENT_VERSION bump.
///
/// IF THE TEST FAILS:
/// - It should only ever happen in response to changes in the persist crate. If
///   it fails otherwise (in particular if it's flaky), that's unexpected and
///   #[ignore] should be added to the test. We'll look into it async.
/// - If a failure happens in response to a persist crate change, the change
///   author determines whether any on-disk encodings changed. If any did, the
///   change author simply bumps the BlobMeta::CURRENT_VERSION and updates the
///   test golden data.
/// - If no on-disk encodings were changed (and the random traffic generator
///   wasn't changed), this is a red flag that something that should be
///   deterministic from the persist crate's external API is no longer
///   deterministic. This should be investigated.
///
/// HOW TO UPDATE "golden_test.json":
/// 1. Truncate the file so that it exists but it's empty (e.g `truncate -s 0 golden_test.json`)
/// 2. Run `cargo test golden_test`
/// 3. The test will print out the new serialization of the golden data as a log line. To update
///    the data, simply copy the printed JSON in to the golden_test.json file as part of the
///    commit. The formatting of the json shouldn't matter, but it should probably stay one line
///    for space reasons, be careful when you save if your editor auto-formats.
