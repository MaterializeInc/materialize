// TODO
// - This method of getting the metadata handle ends up being pretty clunky in
//   practice. Maybe instead the user should pass in a mutable reference to a
//   `Meta` they've constructed like `probe_with`?
// - Error handling. Right now, there are a bunch of `expect`s and this likely
//   needs to hook into the error streams that Materialize hands around.
// - Backward compatibility of persisted data, particularly the encoded keys and
//   values.
// - Restarting with a different number of workers.
// - Abomonation is convenient for prototyping, but we'll likely want to reuse
//   one of the popular serialization libraries.
// - Tighten up the jargon and usage of that jargon: write, update, persist,
//   drain, entry, update, data, log, blob, indexed, unsealed, trace.
// - Think through all the <, <=, !<= usages and document them more correctly
//   (aka replace before/after an antichain with in advance of/not in advance
//   of).
// - Clean up the various ways we pass a (sometimes encoded) entry/update
//   around, there are many for no particular reason: returning an iterator,
//   accepting a closure, accepting a mutable Vec, implementing Snapshot, etc.
// - Meta TODO: These were my immediate thoughts but there's stuff I'm
//   forgetting. Flesh this list out.

// Testing edge cases:
// - Failure while draining from log into unsealed.
// - Equality edge cases around all the various timestamp/frontier checks.
