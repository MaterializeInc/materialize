//! PostgreSQL network ("wire") protocol.
//!
//! For brevity, we often refer to the protocol as "pgwire," hence the name of
//! this module. Beware that this name is only commonly used in the CockroachDB
//! and Materialize ecosystems. The PostgreSQL documentation, for example, uses
//! the long-winded "Frontend/Backend Protocol" title instead.
