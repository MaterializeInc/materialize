/// A hashable, comparable, and serializable regular expression type.
///
/// The  [`regex::Regex`] type, the de facto standard regex type in Rust, does
/// not implement [`PartialOrd`], [`Ord`] [`PartialEq`], [`Eq`], or [`Hash`].
/// The omissions are reasonable. There is no natural definition of ordering for
/// regexes. There *is* a natural definition of equality—whether two regexes
/// describe the same regular language—but that is an expensive property to
/// compute, and [`PartialEq`] is generally expected to be fast to compute.
///
/// This type wraps [`regex::Regex`] and imbues it with implementations of the
/// above traits. Two regexes are considered equal iff their string
/// representation is identical. The [`PartialOrd`], [`Ord`], and [`Hash`]
/// implementations are similarly based upon the string representation. As
/// mentioned above, is not the natural equivalence relation for regexes: for
/// example, the regexes `aa*` and `a+` define the same language, but would not
/// compare as equal with this implementation of [`PartialEq`]. Still, it is
/// often useful to have _some_ equivalence relation available (e.g., to store
/// types containing regexes in a hashmap) even if the equivalence relation is
/// imperfect.
///
/// This type also implements [`Serialize`] and [`Deserialize`] via the
/// [`serde_regex`] crate.
