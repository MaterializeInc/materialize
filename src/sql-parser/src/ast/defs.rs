//! This module houses the definitions of the structs and enums that are
//! formally part of the AST.
//!
//! A few notes about the layout of this module:
//!
//!   * The public interface of the `sql::ast` module exposes all of these types
//!     in one big namespace.
//!
//!     The submodules here exist only to avoid having one massive file with
//!     every type in it. Separation into modules would be annoying for
//!     consumers of the AST, who don't want to remember e.g. whether the
//!     `Ident` type is in the `expr` module or the `name` module or the `value`
//!     module.
//!
//!   * Only types that are actually part of the AST live in this module. This
//!     module's contents are parsed by the build script to e.g. automatically
//!     generate an AST visitor, and the build script gets confused if there are
//!     helper structs interspersed.
//!
//!     Helper structs should live in a separate submodule of `crate::ast`, like
//!     `crate::ast::display`.
//!
//!   * Do *not* import types from this module directly. I.e., use
//!     `crate::ast::Ident`, not `crate::ast::defs::name::Ident`. The former
//!     import path makes it possible to reorganize this module without changing
//!     every `use` statement.
