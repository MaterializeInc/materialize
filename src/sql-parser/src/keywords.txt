# This file contains the keywords known to the Materialize SQL parser.
#
# The format is as follows. Blank lines and lines that start with a '#' are
# ignored. All other lines must contain a reservation type that can be one of
# Reserved, ColumnName, TableAlias, or Unreserved followed exactly one keyword
# with no leading or trailing space. Keywords must appear in sorted order.
# Keyword names are used directly as an enum variant, so they follow the
# standard Rust CamelCase capitalization convention and not the SQL ALLCAPS
# convention.
#
# For keywords also used in Postgres the reservation type should follow the list defined here:
# https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/include/parser/kwlist.h
#
# For details on the code that is generated, see keywords.rs.

# TODO(petrosagg): Interval and Option deviate from the postgres definition
