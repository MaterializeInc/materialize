# This file contains the keywords known to the Materialize SQL parser.
#
# The format is as follows. Blank lines and lines that start with a '#' are
# ignored. All other lines must contain exactly one keyword with no leading or
# trailing space. Keywords must appear in sorted order. Keyword names are used
# directly as an enum variant, so they follow the standard Rust CamelCase
# capitalization convention and not the SQL ALLCAPS convention.
#
# For details on the code that is generated, see keywords.rs.
