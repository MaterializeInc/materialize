//! SQL Parser for Rust
//!
//! Example code:
//!
//! This crate provides an ANSI:SQL 2011 lexer and parser that can parse SQL
//! into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
//!
//! ```
//! use sql_parser::parser::Parser;
//!
//! let sql = "SELECT a, b, 123, myfunc(b) \
//!            FROM table_1 \
//!            WHERE a > b AND b < 100 \
//!            ORDER BY a DESC, b";
//!
//! let ast = Parser::parse_sql(sql.to_string()).unwrap();
//!
//! println!("AST: {:?}", ast);
//! ```
