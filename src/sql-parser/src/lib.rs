//! SQL parser.
//!
//! This crate provides an SQL lexer and parser for Materialize's dialect of
//! SQL.
//!
//! ```
//! use sql_parser::parser;
//!
//! let sql = "SELECT a, b, 123, myfunc(b) \
//!            FROM table_1 \
//!            WHERE a > b AND b < 100 \
//!            ORDER BY a DESC, b";
//!
//! let ast = parser::parse_statements(sql).unwrap();
//! println!("AST: {:?}", ast);
//! ```
