//! PreparedStatements maintain in-progress state during a session
//!
//! In postgres there are two ways to construct prepared statements:
//!
//! * Via an explicit, user-provided `PREPARE <name> AS <sql>` sql statement
//! * As part of the postgres frontend/backend protocol, where prepared statements are
//!   created implicitly by client libraries on behalf of users
//!
//! We do not currently actually support explicit prepared statements, all prepared
//! statements come in via the postgres wire protocol as [`Parse`/`Bind` messages][m] in
//! the [extended query flow][eqf].
//!
//! What that means is that there is a multi-step dance to use prepared statements:
//!
//! 1. Receive a `Parse` message. `Parse` messages included a _name_ for the prepared
//!    statement, in addition to some other possible metadata.
//! 2. After validation, we stash the statement in the [`crate::session::Session`]
//!    associated with the current user's session.
//! 3. The client issues a `Bind` message, which provides a name for a portal, and
//!    associates that name with a previously-named prepared statement. This is the point
//!    at which all possible parameters are associated with the statement, there are no
//!    longer any free variables permited.
//! 4. The client issues an `Execute` message with the name of a portal, causing that
//!    portal to actually start scanning and returning results.
//!
//! The upshot of this is that we need to store arbitrary named Sessions and Portals
//! inside individual Sessions, and this module provides the types that are responsible
//! for maintaining the state provided by the various parts of the dance.
