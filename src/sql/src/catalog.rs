/// The SQL standard mandates a catalog hierarchy of exactly three layers. A
/// catalog contains databases, databases contain schemas, and schemas contain
/// catalog items, like sources, sinks, view, and indexes.
///
/// There are two classes of operations provided by a catalog:
///
///   * Resolution operations, like [`resolve_item`]. These fill in missing name
///     components based upon connection defaults, e.g., resolving the partial
///     name `view42` to the fully-specified name `materialize.public.view42`.
///
///   * Lookup operations, like [`list_items`] or [`get_item`]. These retrieve
///     metadata about a catalog entity based on a fully-specified name that is
///     known to be valid (i.e., because the name was successfully resolved,
///     or was constructed based on the output of a prior lookup operation).
///     These functions panic if called with invalid input.
///
/// [`list_databases`]: Catalog::list_databases
/// [`get_item`]: Catalog::resolve_item
/// [`resolve_item`]: Catalog::resolve_item
