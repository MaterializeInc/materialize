//! SQL-dataflow translation.
//!
//! There are two main parts of the SQLâ€“dataflow translation process:
//!
//!   * **Purification** eliminates any external state from a SQL AST. It is an
//!     asynchronous process that may make network calls to external services.
//!     The input and output of purification is a SQL AST.
//!
//!   * **Planning** converts a purified AST to a [`Plan`], which describes an
//!     action that the system should take to effect the results of the query.
//!     Planning is a fast, pure function that always produces the same plan for
//!     a given input.
//!
//! # Details
//!
//! The purification step is, to our knowledge, unique to Materialize. In other
//! SQL databases, there is no concept of purifying a statement before planning
//! it. The reason for this difference is that in Materialize SQL statements can
//! depend on external state: local files, Confluent Schema Registries, etc.
//!
//! Presently only `CREATE SOURCE` statements can depend on external state,
//! though this could change in the future. Consider, for example:
//!
//! ```sql
//! CREATE SOURCE ... FORMAT AVRO USING CONFLUENT SCHEMA REGISTRY 'http://csr:8081'
//! ```
//!
//! The shape of the created source is dependent on the Avro schema that is
//! stored in the schema registry running at `csr:8081`.
//!
//! This is problematic, because we need planning to be a pure function of its
//! input. Why?
//!
//!   * Planning locks the catalog while it operates. Therefore it needs to be
//!     fast, because only one SQL query can be planned at a time. Depending on
//!     external state while holding a lock on the catalog would be seriously
//!     detrimental to the latency of other queries running on the system.
//!
//!   * The catalog persists SQL ASTs across restarts of Materialize. If those
//!     ASTs depend on external state, then changes to that external state could
//!     corrupt Materialize's catalog.
//!
//! Purification is the escape hatch. It is a transformation from SQL AST to SQL
//! AST that "inlines" any external state. For example, we purify the schema
//! above by fetching the schema from the schema registry and inlining it.
//!
//! ```sql
//! CREATE SOURCE ... FORMAT AVRO USING SCHEMA '{"name": "foo", "fields": [...]}'
//! ```
//!
//! Importantly, purification runs without access to the catalog. That means it
//! can run in its own Tokio task so that it does not block any other SQL
//! commands on the server.
//!
