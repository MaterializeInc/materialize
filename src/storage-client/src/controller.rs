//! A controller that provides an interface to the storage layer.
//!
//! The storage controller curates the creation of sources, the progress of readers through these collections,
//! and their eventual dropping and resource reclamation.
//!
//! The storage controller can be viewed as a partial map from `GlobalId` to collection. It is an error to
//! use an identifier before it has been "created" with `create_source()`. Once created, the controller holds
//! a read capability for each source, which is manipulated with `update_read_capabilities()`.
//! Eventually, the source is dropped with either `drop_sources()` or by allowing compaction to the
//! empty frontier.
