//! SSH tunnel management for the storage layer.

// NOTE(benesch): The synchronization in this module is tricky because SSH
// tunnels 1) require an async `connect` method that can return errors and 2)
// once connected, launch a long-running background task whose handle must be
// managed. The manager would be far simpler if `connect` was neither async nor
// fallible and instead synchronously returned a handle to the background task.
// That would require a different means of asynchronously reporting SSH tunnel
// errors, though, and that's a large project. A worthwhile project, though: at
// present SSH tunnel errors that occur after the initial connection are
// reported only to the logs, and not to users.
