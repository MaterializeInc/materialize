//! Render an operator that persists a source collection.
//!
//! ## Implementation
//!
//! This module defines the `persist_sink` operator, that writes
//! a collection produced by source rendering into a persist shard.
//!
//! It attempts to use all workers to write data to persist, and uses
//! single-instance workers to coordinate work. The below diagram
//! is an overview how it it shaped. There is more information
//! in the doc comments of the top-level functions of this module.

//! ## Similarities with `mz_compute::sink::persist_sink`
//!
//! This module has many similarities with the compute version of
//! the same concept, and in fact, is entirely derived from it.
//!
//! Compute requires that its `persist_sink` is _self-correcting_;
//! that is, it corrects what the collection in persist
//! accumulates to if the collection has values changed at
//! previous timestamps. It does this by continually comparing
//! the input stream with the collection as read back from persist.
//!
//! Source collections, while definite, cannot be reliably by
//! re-produced once written down, which means compute's
//! `persist_sink`'s self-correction mechanism would need to be
//! skipped on operator startup, and would cause unnecessary read
//! load on persist.
//!
//! Additionally, persisting sources requires we use bounded
//! amounts of memory, even if a single timestamp represents
//! a huge amount of data. This is not (currently) possible
//! to guarantee while also performing self-correction.
//!
//! Because of this, we have ripped out the self-correction
//! mechanism, and aggressively simplified the sub-operators.
//! Some, particularly `append_batches` could be merged with
//! the compute version, but that requires some amount of
//! onerous refactoring that we have chosen to skip for now.
//!
// TODO(guswynn): merge at least the `append_batches` operator`
