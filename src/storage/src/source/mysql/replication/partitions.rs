/// The active partitions are all singleton partitions representing a single
/// source-id timestamp, and the future partitions represent the missing
/// UUID ranges that we have not yet seen and are held at timestamp GtidState::Absent.
///
/// This is used to keep track of all partitions and is updated as we receive
/// new GTID updates from the server, and is used to create a full 'frontier'
/// representing the current state of all GTID partitions that we can use
/// to downgrade capabilities for the source.
///
/// We could instead mint capabilities for each individual partition
/// and advance each partition as a frontier separately using its own capabilities,
/// but since this is used inside a fallible operator if we ever hit any errors
/// then all newly minted capabilities would be dropped by the async runtime
/// and we might lose the ability to send any more data.
/// However if we just use the main capabilities provided to the operator, the
/// capabilities externally will be preserved even in the case of an error in
/// the operator, which is why we just manage a single frontier and capability set.
