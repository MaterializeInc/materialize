/// This trait defines the interface between Materialize and external sources,
/// and must be implemented for every new kind of source.
///
/// ## Contract between [`SourceReader`] and the ingestion framework
///
/// A source reader uses updates emitted from
/// [`SourceReader::next`]/[`SourceReader::get_next_message`] to update the
/// ingestion framework about new updates retrieved from the external system and
/// about its internal state.
///
/// The framework will spawn a [`SourceReader`] on each timely worker. It is the
/// responsibility of the reader to figure out which of the partitions (if any)
/// it is responsible for reading using [`crate::source::responsible_for`].
///
/// The reader implicitly is given a capability for emitting updates for each
/// new partition (identified by a [`PartitionId`]) that it discovers. It must
/// downgrade those capabilities by either emitting updates for those partitions
/// that it is responsible for or by emitting a
/// [`SourceMessageType::DropPartitionCapabilities`] for those partitions which
/// it is not responsible for.
//
// TODO: this trait is still a little too Kafka-centric, specifically the concept of
// a "partition" is baked into this trait and introduces some cognitive overhead as
// we are forced to treat things like file sources as "single-partition"
