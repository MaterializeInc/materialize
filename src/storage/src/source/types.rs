    /// must contain *definite*[^1] data for all times beyond the resumption frontier.

    /// Second, a source may produce an optional progress stream that will be used to drive
    /// reclocking. This is useful for sources that can query the highest offsets of the external
    /// source before reading the data for those offsets. In those cases it is preferable to
    /// produce this additional stream.
    ///
    /// Third, a source must produce a stream of health status updates.

    /// source to immediately drop all capabilities and advance its frontier to the empty antichain.
