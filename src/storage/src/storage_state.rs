//! Worker-local state for storage timely instances.
//!
//! One instance of a [`Worker`], along with its contained [`StorageState`], is
//! part of an ensemble of storage workers that all run inside the same timely
//! cluster. We call this worker a _storage worker_ to disambiguate it from
//! other kinds of workers, potentially other components that might be sharing
//! the same timely cluster.
//!
//! ## Controller and internal communication
//!
//! A worker receives _external_ [`StorageCommands`](StorageCommand) from the
//! storage controller, via a channel. Storage workers also share an _internal_
//! control/command fabric ([`internal_control`]). Internal commands go through
//! a sequencer dataflow that ensures that all workers receive all commands in
//! the same consistent order.
//!
//! We need to make sure that commands that cause dataflows to be rendered are
//! processed in the same consistent order across all workers because timely
//! requires this. To achieve this, we make sure that only internal commands can
//! cause dataflows to be rendered. External commands (from the controller)
//! cause internal commands to be broadcast (by only one worker), to get
//! dataflows rendered.
//!
//! The internal command fabric is also used to broadcast messages from a local
//! operator/worker to all workers. For example, when we need to tear down and
//! restart a dataflow on all workers when an error is encountered.
//!
//! ## Async Storage Worker
//!
//! The storage worker has a companion [`AsyncStorageWorker`] that must be used
//! when running code that requires `async`. This is needed because a timely
//! main loop cannot run `async` code.
//!
//! ## Example flow of commands for `RunIngestions`
//!
//! With external commands, internal commands, and the async worker,
//! understanding where and how commands from the controller are realized can
//! get complicated. We will follow the complete flow for `RunIngestions`, as an
//! example:
//!
//! 1. Worker receives a [`StorageCommand::RunIngestions`] command from the
//!    controller.
//! 2. This command is processed in [`StorageState::handle_storage_command`].
//!    This step cannot render dataflows, because it does not have access to the
//!    timely worker. It will only set up state that stays over the whole
//!    lifetime of the source, such as the `reported_frontier`. Putting in place
//!    this reported frontier will enable frontier reporting for that source. We
//!    will not start reporting when we only see an internal command for
//!    rendering a dataflow, which can "overtake" the external `RunIngestions`
//!    command.
//! 3. During processing of that command, we call
//!    [`AsyncStorageWorker::update_frontiers`], which causes a command to
//!    be sent to the async worker.
//! 4. We eventually get a response from the async worker:
//!    [`AsyncStorageWorkerResponse::FrontiersUpdated`].
//! 5. This response is handled in [`Worker::handle_async_worker_response`].
//! 6. Handling that response causes a
//!    [`InternalStorageCommand::CreateIngestionDataflow`] to be broadcast to
//!    all workers via the internal command fabric.
//! 7. This message will be processed (on each worker) in
//!    [`Worker::handle_internal_storage_command`]. This is what will cause the
//!    required dataflow to be rendered on all workers.
//!
//! The process described above assumes that the `RunIngestions` is _not_ an
//! update, i.e. it is in response to a `CREATE SOURCE`-like statement.
//!
//! The primary distinction when handling a `RunIngestions` that represents an
//! update, is that it might fill out new internal state in the mid-level
//! clients on the way toward being run.
