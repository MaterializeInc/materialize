        // NOTE(benesch): it is critical that we invent a new topic name on
        // every testdrive run. We previously tried to delete and recreate the
        // topic with a fixed name, but ran into serious race conditions in
        // Kafka that would regularly cause CI to hang. Details follow.
        //
        // Kafka topic creation and deletion is documented to be asynchronous.
        // That seems fine at first, as the Kafka admin API exposes an
        // `operation_timeout` option that would appear to allow you to opt into
        // a synchronous request by setting a massive timeout. As it turns out,
        // this parameter doesn't actually do anything [0].
        //
        // So, fine, we can implement our own polling for topic creation and
        // deletion, since the Kafka API exposes the list of topics currently
        // known to Kafka. This polling works well enough for topic creation.
        // After issuing a CreateTopics request, we poll the metadata list until
        // the topic appears with the requested number of partitions. (Yes,
        // sometimes the topic will appear with the wrong number of partitions
        // at first, and later sort itself out.)
        //
        // For deletion, though, there's another problem. Not only is deletion
        // of the topic metadata asynchronous, but deletion of the
        // topic data is *also* asynchronous, and independently so. As best as
        // I can tell, the following sequence of events is not only plausible,
        // but likely:
        //
        //     1. Client issues DeleteTopics(FOO).
        //     2. Kafka launches garbage collection of topic FOO.
        //     3. Kafka deletes metadata for topic FOO.
        //     4. Client polls and discovers topic FOO's metadata is gone.
        //     5. Client issues CreateTopics(FOO).
        //     6. Client writes some data to topic FOO.
        //     7. Kafka deletes data for topic FOO, including the data that was
        //        written to the second incarnation of topic FOO.
        //     8. Client attempts to read data written to topic FOO and waits
        //        forever, since there is no longer any data in the topic.
        //        Client becomes very confused and sad.
        //
        // There doesn't appear to be any sane way to poll to determine whether
        // the data has been deleted, since Kafka doesn't expose how many
        // messages are in a topic, and it's therefore impossible to distinguish
        // an empty topic from a deleted topic. And that's not even accounting
        // for the behavior when auto.create.topics.enable is true, which it
        // is by default, where asking about a topic that doesn't exist will
        // automatically create it.
        //
        // All this to say: please think twice before changing the topic naming
        // strategy.
