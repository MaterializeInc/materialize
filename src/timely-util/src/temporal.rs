/// in the future. At the same time, in a well-formed chain, adjacent buckets span a time range at
/// most factor 4 different. Factor 4 means that we can skip at most one bucket size for adjacent
/// buckets, limiting the amount of work we need to do when peeling off buckets or restoring the
/// chain property.
///
/// A bucket chain is well-formed if all buckets are within two bits of each other, with an imaginary
/// bucket of -2 bits at the start. A chain does not need to be well-formed at all times, and supports
/// peeling and finding even if not well-formed. However, `peel` might need to split more buckets to
/// extract the desired data.
///
/// The `restore` method can be used to restore the chain property. It needs to be called repeatedly
/// with a positive amount of fuel while the remaining fuel after the call is non-positive. This
/// allows the caller to control the amount of work done in a single call and interleave it with
/// other work.
