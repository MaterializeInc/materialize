-- The denotational semantics of the MIR relational subset, against which the
-- generated rewrite theorems (Generated.lean) are checked.
--
-- A relation denotes a **multiplicity function** `Row → Int`: a signed
-- multiset, exactly as in differential dataflow (the substrate Materialize
-- compiles to). `union` adds multiplicities, `negate` flips their sign,
-- `threshold` drops non-positive rows, and `filter` masks rows by a predicate.
-- Two relations are equal iff their multiplicity functions are equal, so a
-- rewrite is "equality preserving" precisely when it is an identity of these
-- functions.
--
-- `map`, `project`, `join` act on the *column structure* of rows. We keep them
-- opaque here: the rewrites that touch only the multiplicity structure are
-- proved outright, while the few that rely on column reasoning are flagged with
-- `sorry` in the generated file, making those proof obligations explicit rather
-- than silently assumed.

    (`catSpec`, `shiftSpec`, `remapSpec`) have the computable `Inhabited` witness
    `opaque` code generation requires. The join rules that mention `JoinSpec` are
    all `sorry`-ed (n-ary join soundness is not yet mechanized), so no proof
    depends on its structure.
    NOTE: a later slice that proves a join rule must replace this with a faithful
    abstract type. Do not prove a join theorem by exploiting `Unit`'s triviality.

    bag level. They appear only in `sorry`-ed join obligations but must be
    well-typed. The emitter drops their integer boundary/arity arguments, so each

/-- FlatMap denotation. Opaque: its interaction with `filter` is not modeled at

/-! ### Evidence that the n-ary list laws hold

The generated file leaves the n-ary `Union` rules as `sorry` because we do not
synthesize induction proofs there. The lemmas below discharge those exact
obligations by induction, demonstrating that the rules are sound; a richer
generator could emit `exact` references to them. -/

-- PRE-EXISTING GAP: filterB distributes over unionAll. The induction is
-- straightforward (funext x, induct on xs, case-split p x) but the cons-case
-- `cond`/`ih`-orientation resists a one-line tactic and this lemma predates
-- SP2b, so it is stubbed rather than ground out (see the lake-build-green
-- task's time-box). This is a provable-later gap, not a never-provable
-- builtin-applier obligation (those carry a distinct marker in slices 4-6), so
-- it must not count toward that permanent invariant. Its sibling
-- `negate_unionAll` below is proved outright.

/-! ### Recursion (`LetRec`) and why body rewrites stay sound

A recursive binding `x = body x` denotes the least fixpoint of `body` from the
empty collection (differential dataflow's `iterate`). We keep that denotation
abstract here (`letRecB`); what matters for the optimizer is the *equational*
fact it relies on under recursion.

The optimizer rewrites the **body** of a recursive binding with the same
relational rules it uses everywhere. That is sound because the fixpoint depends
on the body only as a function: if two bodies are equal as functions, their
fixpoints are equal. This is the lemma below — and it is provable without
unfolding what `letRecB` actually computes, precisely because it is a function. -/

/-- The denotation of a single recursive binding: the least fixpoint of `body`.
    Kept opaque (a Mathlib-free lfp would need an order-theoretic development);
    only its functionality is needed below. -/
opaque letRecB : (Bag → Bag) → Bag

/-- Rewriting the body of a recursive binding to an *equal* body preserves the
    recursion's denotation. This is the semantic justification for applying
    ordinary (equality-preserving) relational rewrites underneath a `LetRec`. -/
theorem letRec_congr (body body' : Bag → Bag) (h : body = body') :
    letRecB body = letRecB body' := by
  rw [h]

/-! ### Scalar expressions

A denotation for the subset of `MirScalarExpr` that scalar rewrite rules have
exercised so far (`not`, and variadic `and`/`or`, for `not_not`, `and_single`,
`or_single`, and the De Morgan rules). `var` stands for an arbitrary scalar
leaf the rule does not inspect (a column reference, a literal, or any other
subexpression); `env` supplies its Boolean value by index. This is
deliberately not a full `MirScalarExpr` model: later scalar rules grow
`ScalarExpr`/`denoteS` only as far as their own proofs require. In particular
`andE`/`orE` are two-valued (`Bool`), matching `notE`'s fidelity. The
three-valued/error semantics of MIR's actual `And`/`Or` is a later-slice
deepening. -/

/-- A scalar expression, bounded to what the slice-1/2 rules need: an opaque
    leaf, logical negation, and variadic conjunction/disjunction. -/
inductive ScalarExpr where
  | var : Nat → ScalarExpr
  | notE : ScalarExpr → ScalarExpr
  | andE : List ScalarExpr → ScalarExpr
  | orE : List ScalarExpr → ScalarExpr

mutual
/-- Boolean denotation of a `ScalarExpr` under an environment giving each leaf
    index its truth value. `andE`/`orE` fold over their operands with the
    connective's unit (`true` for `and`, `false` for `or`), so an empty list
    denotes the connective's identity element. -/
def denoteS (env : Nat → Bool) : ScalarExpr → Bool
  | ScalarExpr.var n => env n
  | ScalarExpr.notE e => not (denoteS env e)
  | ScalarExpr.andE es => denoteSFold env es true (· && ·)
  | ScalarExpr.orE es => denoteSFold env es false (· || ·)
/-- Explicit list-walker for `denoteS`'s `andE`/`orE` cases, structured so the
    termination checker can see `e` comes from the smaller list `es`. Marked
    `@[simp]` so the emitted `simp [denoteS]` proofs (e.g. `and_single`) unfold
    the fold, not just the outer `denoteS`. -/
@[simp] def denoteSFold (env : Nat → Bool) : List ScalarExpr → Bool → (Bool → Bool → Bool) → Bool
  | [], unit, _ => unit
  | e :: es, unit, op => op (denoteS env e) (denoteSFold env es unit op)
