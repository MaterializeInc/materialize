//! Canonicalizes MFPs and performs common sub-expression elimination.
//!
//! This transform takes a sequence of Maps, Filters, and Projects and
//! canonicalizes it to a sequence like this:
//! | Filter
//! | Map
//! | Filter
//! | Project
//! The filters before the map are those that can be
//! pushed down through a map according the rules of
//! [crate::projection_pushdown::ProjectionPushdown.push_filters_through_map()].
//! TODO: It would be nice to canonicalize it to just an MFP, but currently
//! putting a filter after instead of before a Map can result in the loss of
//! nullability information.
//!
//! After canonicalizing, this transform looks at the Map-Filter-Project
//! subsequence and identifies common `ScalarExpr` expressions across and within
//! expressions that are arguments to the Map-Filter-Project. It reforms the
//! `Map-Filter-Project` subsequence to build each distinct expression at most
//! once and to re-use expressions instead of re-evaluating them.
//!
//! The re-use policy at the moment is severe and re-uses everything.
//! It may be worth considering relations of this if it results in more
//! busywork and less efficiency, but the wins can be substantial when
//! expressions re-use complex subexpressions.
