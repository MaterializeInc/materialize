//! Propagates expression equivalence from leaves to root, and back down again.
//!
//! Expression equivalences are `MirScalarExpr` replacements by simpler expressions.
//! These equivalences derive from
//!   Filters:  predicates must evaluate to `Datum::True`.
//!   Maps:     new columns equal the expressions that define them.
//!   Joins:    equated columns must be equal.
//!   Others:   lots of other predicates we might learn (range constraints on aggregates; non-negativity)
//!
//! From leaf to root the equivalences are *enforced*, and communicate that the expression will not produce rows that do not satisfy the equivalence.
//! From root to leaf the equivalences are *advised*, and communicate that the expression may discard any outputs that do not satisfy the equivalence.
//!
//! Importantly, in descent the operator *may not* assume any equivalence filtering will be applied to its results.
//! It cannot therefore produce rows it would otherwise not, even rows that do not satisfy the equivalence.
//! Operators *may* introduce filtering in descent, and they must do so to take further advantage of the equivalences.
//!
//! The subtlety is due to the expressions themselves causing the equivalences, and allowing more rows may invalidate equivalences.
//! For example, we might learn that `Column(7)` equals `Literal(3)`, but must refrain from introducing that substitution in descent,
//! because it is possible that the equivalence derives from restrictions in the expression we are visiting. Were we certain that the
//! equivalence was independent of the expression (e.g. through a more nuanced expression traversal) we could imaging relaxing this.
