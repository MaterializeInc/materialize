//! Normalize the structure of `Let` and `LetRec` operators in expressions.
//!
//! Normalization happens in the context of "scopes", corresponding to
//! 1. the expression's root and 2. each instance of a `LetRec` AST node.
//!
//! Within each scope,
//! 1. Each expression is normalized to have all `Let` nodes at the root
//! of the expression, in order of identifier.
//! 2. Each expression assigns a contiguous block of identifiers.
//!
//! The transform may remove some `Let` and `Get` operators, and does not
//! introduce any new operators.
//!
//! The module also publishes the function `renumber_bindings` which can
//! be used to renumber bindings in an expression starting from a provided
//! `IdGen`, which is used to prepare distinct expressions for inlining.
