/// An index with an empty key is maximally skewed (all of the data goes to a single worker),
/// and is almost never really useful. It's slightly useful for a cross join, because a cross
/// join also has an empty key, so we avoid rearranging the input. However, this is still
/// not very useful, because
///  - Rearranging the input shouldn't take too much memory, because if a cross join has a big
///    input, then we have a serious problem anyway.
///  - Even with the arrangement already there, the cross join will read every input record, so
///    the orders of magnitude performance improvements that can happen with other joins when an
///    input arrangement exists can't happen with a cross join.
/// Also note that skew is hard to debug, so it's good to avoid this problem in the first place.
