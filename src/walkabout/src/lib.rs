//! Visitor generation for Rust structs and enums.
//!
//! Usage documentation is a work in progress, but for an example of the
//! generated visitor, see the [`sqlparser::ast::visit`] module.
//!
//! Some of our ASTs, which we represent with a tree of Rust structs and enums,
//! are sufficiently complicated that maintaining a visitor by hand is onerous.
//! This crate provides a generalizable framework for parsing Rust struct and
//! enum definitions from source code and automatically generating tree
//! traversal ("visitor") code.
//!
//! Note that the desired structure of the `Visit` and `VisitMut` traits
//! precludes the use of a custom derive procedural macro. We need to consider
//! the entire AST at once to build the `Visit` and `VisitMut` traits, and
//! derive macros only allow you to see one struct at a time.
//!
//! The design of the visitors is modeled after the visitors provided by the
//! [`syn`] crate. See: <https://github.com/dtolnay/syn/tree/master/codegen>
//!
//! The name of this crate is an homage to CockroachDB's
//! [Go package of the same name][crdb-walkabout].
//!
//! [`sqlparser::ast::visit`]: ../sql_parser/ast/visit/
