# Running manually

To run the cloud canary test manually, a set of environment variables need to be made available locally:

```
export MZ_USERNAME=...
export MZ_APP_PASSWORD=...
```

Once the environment variables have been set, you can run:

```
cd test/cluster-spec-sheet
./mzcompose run default
```
