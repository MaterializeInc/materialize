# Assumptions encoded here:
# (1) "Inner" statement executions are not logged. For example,
#     if SQL-level `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` are used, those statements will
#     be logged, but not the statements they reference.
# (2) We don't have a way to log errors that happen during statement preparation,
#     but only during statement execution.
# (3) SQL-level statements always use a prepared statement with a useless name beginning with 's'
# (4) `FETCH` has the somewhat confusing behavior of reporting the `result_size` and `rows_returned`
#     of the *total* result set in the first `FETCH`, and null thereafter.
#
# All of these (except (3), which is just how the postgres library TD uses works) are working as designed.
# However, we recognize that they are confusing, so we will work on making them
# less confusing as follow-ups.
#
# When we do so, we will need to change this test to encode the improved behavior.
