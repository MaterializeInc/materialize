# Tests mzcompose itself.

# NOTE(benesch): this is not an ideal testing framework. Please try to refrain
# from adding additional tests here. If the feature that you are adding to
# mzcompose is complicated enough that mzcompose *itself* needs tests, then
# it is likely that the feature needs to be rethought to be less complicated.
