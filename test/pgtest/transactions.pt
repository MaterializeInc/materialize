# Test implicit and explicit transaction semantics.
# See "Multiple Statements in a Simple Query"
# From https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html

# Note: all of the "SELECT 1/(SELECT 0)" things are here to produce a
# query error. We do not use SELECT 1/0 because in Postgres that doesn't
# send a RowDescription message while the former does. This is probably
# due to Postgres constant folding rules that run before its execution
# phase. This isn't important to the protocol, and both (sending or not
# sending RowDescription) are valid. Because we send a RowDescription
# on SELECT 1/0, we use the more complicated form to force Postgres to
# also send one, unifying the responses here.

# "When a simple Query message contains more than one SQL statement
# (separated by semicolons), those statements are executed as a single
# transaction, unless explicit transaction control commands are included
# to force a different behavior."
