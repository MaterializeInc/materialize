    # Due to interactions between docker-compose, entrypoint, command, and bash, it is not possible to have
    # a more complex filtering expression in 'command' . So we basically run the entire testdrive suite here
    # except tests that contain features known to be not supported by Redpanda. So the run includes testdrive
    # tests that do not touch Kafka at all.
