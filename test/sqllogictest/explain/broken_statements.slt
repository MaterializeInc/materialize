# Tests for panics in the optimizer pipeline. Unfortunately we don't have a good
# way to inject a panic after the global optimization stage, which is why we
# only test that:
#
# 1. The RAW returns a result.
# 2. The DECORRELATED returns a result.
# 3. The OPTIMIZED plan an error.
# 4. The PHYSICAL PLAN returns an error.
# 5. The OPTIMIZER TRACE returns a partial.
#
# Further, we do this for each statement type supported as an explainee.
