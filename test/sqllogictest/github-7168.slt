# Regression test for https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/7168.

# The shape of this table would reliably trigger memory unsafety. The datums
# were exactly the right length to corrupt the stack given the bug. It's
# unlikely that these specific datums will do much to prevent memory unsafety in
# the future, but keeping this test doesn't hurt.
