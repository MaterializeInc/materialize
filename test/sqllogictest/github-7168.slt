# Regression test for https://github.com/MaterializeInc/database-issues/issues/2235.
#
# The shape of this table would reliably trigger memory unsafety. The datums
# were exactly the right length to corrupt the stack given the bug. It's
# unlikely that these specific datums will do much to prevent memory unsafety in
# the future, but keeping this test doesn't hurt.
