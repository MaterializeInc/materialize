# NOTE(vmarcos): Even though placement of an Mfp that has parts that can be
# fused on top of a Reduce::Distinct is valid LIR, we should not at present produce
# this pattern via SQL. To see why, note that if the MFP has parts that could be fused,
# then it must preserve the reduction key, i.e., all columns for the distinct, and
# the fusable parts need to be: (a) free of temporal filters; (b) only contain map
# and filter (i.e., essentially be a predicate). So, these fusable parts could just as
# well be applied to the input to the Reduce::Distinct, and the optimizer will just
# perform predicate pushdown to filter the input before it gets arranged. Additionally,
# if it were the case that we would lift the predicate to enable reuse, then that would
# mean that we could not fuse it into the reduction anyway.
