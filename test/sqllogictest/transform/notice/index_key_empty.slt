Notices:
  - Notice: Empty index key. The index will be completely skewed to one worker thread, which can lead to performance problems.
    Hint: CREATE DEFAULT INDEX is almost always better than an index with an empty key. (Except for cross joins with big inputs, which are better to avoid anyway.)

CREATE DEFAULT INDEX is almost always better than an index with an empty key. (Except for cross joins with big inputs, which are better to avoid anyway.)
Drop the encosing index and re-create it using `CREATE DEFAULT INDEX ON` instead.
