# Test detection of topic recreation.
#
# The Kafka source detects topic recreation based on regression of the upstream
# frontier. For the upstream frontier to regress, the new topic must have:
#  (1) fewer partitions than the old topic, or
#  (2) a lower watermark for at least one of its partitions.
# We test both cases below.

# (1) topic recreation with fewer partitions.

# deletion before the new topic was created.

# Even though `kafka-delete-topic` ensures that the topic no longer exists in
# the broker metadata there is still work to be done asynchronously before it's
# truly gone that must complete before we attempt to recreate it. There is no
# way to observe this work completing so the only option left is sleeping for a
# while. This is the sad state of Kafka. If this test ever becomes flaky let's
# just delete it.
