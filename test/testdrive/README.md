TestDrive Tests
===============

Testdrive tests communicate with materialized over the network instead of in-process (as SLT does)
and supports pluggable commands that allow interaction with external systems, e.g. Kafka or AWS.

Documentation is in the testdrive section of [the testing guide][guide].
