# These tests are flaky and take a while to ensure a timeout inside of
# materialized is reached, both of which need to be resolved before this can be
# enabled.
#
# Flakiness documented here: https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/6355
#
# We'd also want to be able to explicitly set the retry timeout inside this
# file instead of relying on an arbitrary number, which probably depends on
# https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/7115
