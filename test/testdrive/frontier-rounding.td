# Tests checking that frontiers of storage collections, at least when they
# don't receive data updates, are rounded to seconds. This is important because
# it ensures that all dataflow sources tick forward at the same time, reducing
# the number of distinct times dataflows have to process, thus removing some
# overhead.
#
# Note that we expect frontiers to be of the form XX..XX001, i.e. rounded to
# seconds and then stepped forward. That's because things that tick forward
# collections choose XX..XX000 as the append timestamp, and then the new write
# frontier must be greater than that.
#
# The rounding is currently not working correctly for tables, compute
# introspection sources, storage-managed collections. See database-issues#9030.
