# Regression test for https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/21031.
#
# This test confirms that subscribes that advance to the empty frontier are
# fully cleaned up.
#

# This test uses introspection queries that need to be targeted to a replica
> SET cluster_replica = r1

# This test relies on testdrive's automatic retries, since it queries
# introspection sources that take a while to update.

# To ensure that the subscribe has reached the introspection sources, we

# are not serializable, but dataflows still show up in order.
