# Test that `mz_dataflow_arrangement_sizes` produces sensible results with accumulable reductions.

# to contain ((24 + 24) + 4) + (8 + 8) = 68 bytes per element, while for c2 we will have one with
# (24 + 4) + (8 + (24 + 8 + [104|112])) = [172|180] bytes per element and the other one with
# (24 + 4) + (24 + 4) + (8 + 8) = 72 bytes per element. Note that the range for c2 comes from
# different alignments for the enum Accum in ARM vs. x86 (namely, 16 vs. 8). Otherwise, the numbers
# come from row keys and values taking 24 bytes, offsets 4 bytes, timestamps 8 bytes, regular diffs
# 8 bytes, and reduce accumulable diffs [136|144] bytes.
