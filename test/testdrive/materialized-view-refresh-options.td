## Test turning replicas off and on, part 1:
## First, we check the following two things:
## - 1a. Turn the replica off just after a refresh, and then turn the replica back on immediately.
## - 1b. Turn the replica off just after a refresh, and then turn the replica back on only after the next refresh time
##   has passed.
